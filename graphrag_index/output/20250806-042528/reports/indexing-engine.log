It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan\'s shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz\'s narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor\'s, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n################\nOutput:\n("entity"<|>"Alex"<|>"person"<|>"Alex is a character who experiences frustration and is observant of the dynamics among other characters.")##\n("entity"<|>"Taylor"<|>"person"<|>"Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty and shows a moment of reverence towards a device, indicating a change in perspective.")##\n("entity"<|>"Jordan"<|>"person"<|>"Jordan shares a commitment to discovery and has a significant interaction with Taylor regarding a device.")##\n("entity"<|>"Cruz"<|>"person"<|>"Cruz is associated with a vision of control and order, influencing the dynamics among other characters.")##\n("entity"<|>"The Device"<|>"technology"<|>"The Device is central to the story, with potential game-changing implications, and is revered by Taylor.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Alex"<|>"Taylor"<|>"Alex is affected by Taylor\'s authoritarian certainty and observes changes in Taylor\'s attitude towards the device."<|>7)##\n("relationship"<|>"Alex"<|>"Jordan"<|>"Alex and Jordan share a commitment to discovery, which contrasts with Cruz\'s vision."<|>6)##\n("relationship"<|>"Taylor"<|>"Jordan"<|>"Taylor and Jordan interact directly regarding the device, leading to a moment of mutual respect and an uneasy truce."<|>8)##\n("relationship"<|>"Jordan"<|>"Cruz"<|>"Jordan\'s commitment to discovery is in rebellion against Cruz\'s vision of control and order."<|>5)##\n("relationship"<|>"Taylor"<|>"The Device"<|>"Taylor shows reverence towards the device, indicating its importance and potential impact."<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\nExample 2:\n\nEntity_types: [person, technology, mission, organization, location]\nText:\nThey were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.\n\nTension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them.

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should\nalways diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye\nthe base and the apex of a pyramid. This being the case, if the eye\nconsisted of a million worlds, it would not prevent its being\nconsumed in the projection of its virtue; and if this virtue would\nhave to travel through the air as perfumes do, the winds would bent\nit and carry it into another place. But we do [in fact] see the mass\nof the sun with the same rapidity as [an object] at the distance of\na braccio, and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of\nthe winds nor by any other accident.\n\n[Footnote: The view here refuted by Leonardo was maintained among\nothers by Bramantino, Leonardo\'s Milanese contemporary. LOMAZZO\nwrites as follows in his Trattato dell\' Arte della pittura &c.\n(Milano 1584. Libr. V cp. XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself. And is repeated, the whole every-where, and the whole in\nevery smallest part. This can be proved by experiment, since if you\nshut a window that faces west and make a hole [Footnote: 6.

Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere.

Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies.

This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI.

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading\nmatter, absorbs light and heat, and reflects in itself the image of\nthe source of that heat and splendour and, in each minutest portion,\ndoes the same. The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;\nand the moon and the other planets, without suffering any\ndiminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same\nand other perfumes.\n\n61.\n\nAll bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding\nair an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each\ncomplete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body\nwhich produces it.\n\nIt can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,\nall-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in\nitself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images\nof the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation\nthrough which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and\ncause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside\ndown on the dark plane where they are first reflected.

The three\ncircles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which\ntransmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark\nchamber, according to a law which is more fully explained in 75?81.\nSo far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended\nto explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to\ncoalesce at any given spot. In the circles are written,\ngiallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.\n\nThe text breaks off at line 8. The paragraph No.40 follows here in\nthe original MS.]\n\n62.\n\nEvery point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which\ndiverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same\nlines converge to a pyramid [imaging] both the colour and form. No\nsooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines\nand angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing\nthemselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an\ninfinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each\nopposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion\nequal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of\nthe 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.\n\n63.\n\nEvery body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with\ninfinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused\nin the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.\nEach pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes\nwithin itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same\npower as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of\nvision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at\neach point will see the object of the same size. The body of the\natmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating\nstraight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in\nlight and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from\nthe object which produces them the more acute they become and\nalthough in their distribution they intersect and cross they never\nmingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,\nindependently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all\nof equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to\nall. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all\nspace and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,\nin each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.\n\n64.\n\nThe body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids\nproduced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each,\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di\npittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they\nwill be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. "With regard\nto the passage attributed to Demetrius", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING\nwrites, "I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not\nDemetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius\nPoliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?\nIt may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the\nspirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any\ncorresponding passage either in the \'Fragments\' (C. MULLER, _Orat.\nAtt._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.\nMus._, vol. 29, p. 108)."\n\nThe same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,\napparently as a note for this \'_Proemio_\' thus affording some data\nas to the time where these introductions were written.] declared\nthat he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth\nin words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who\ndesire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that\nof wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.\nFor so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more\nnoble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:'}

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at.

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

Practice must always be founded\non sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the\ngateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of\ndrawing.\n\n20.\n\nThe painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any\nreason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of\nit without being conscious of their existence.\n\nThe function of the eye (21-23).\n\n21.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.\n\nBehold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\nnote to No. 70.]\n\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.\n\n24.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nVariability of the eye.\n\n1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this and the\npreceding one, No. 9.]\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI am fully concious that, not being a literary man, certain\npresumptuous persons will think that they may reasonably blame me;\nalleging that I am not a man of letters. Foolish folks! do they not\nknow that I might retort as Marius did to the Roman Patricians\n[Footnote 21: _Come Mario disse ai patriti Romani_. "I am unable to\nfind the words here attributed by Leonardo to Marius, either in\nPlutarch\'s Life of Marius or in the Apophthegmata (_Moralia_,\np.202). Nor do they occur in the writings of Valerius Maximus (who\nfrequently mentions Marius) nor in Velleius Paterculus (II, 11 to\n43), Dio Cassius, Aulus Gellius, or Macrobius. Professor E.\nMENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such\npassage is the found in that author" (communication from Dr. MULLER\nSTRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known\nincident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result\nprobably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,\nMenenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter\nPatriti to Plebei. The change is a serious one. but it would render\nthe passage perfectly clear.] by saying: That they, who deck\nthemselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own.\nThey will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly\nexpress that which I desire to treat of [Footnote 26: _le mie cose\n.... che d\'altra parola_. This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.\nRAVAISSON\'S estimate of L. da Vinci\'s learning. "_Leonard de Vinci\netait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans\nl\'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux\nyeux de la posterite._" _Gaz. des Beaux arts.

And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In\nthis branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those\nmethods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of\nMathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both\n[Footnote: 5.

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_. Then [again] bring it closer to\n######################\nOutput:'}

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at.

And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23. These lines stand between the diagrams I and III.]\n\n[Footnote: 24--53. These lines stand between the diagrams I and II.]\n\n[Footnote: 54--97 are written along the left side of diagram I.]\n\n82.\n\nAn experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from\nits position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their\nplaces.\n\nIf you look at an object at some distance from you and which is\nbelow the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand\nfirmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the\nunder lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you\nwill see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the\nother moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger\non the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

"I am unable to\nfind the words here attributed by Leonardo to Marius, either in\nPlutarch\'s Life of Marius or in the Apophthegmata (_Moralia_,\np.202). Nor do they occur in the writings of Valerius Maximus (who\nfrequently mentions Marius) nor in Velleius Paterculus (II, 11 to\n43), Dio Cassius, Aulus Gellius, or Macrobius. Professor E.\nMENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such\npassage is the found in that author" (communication from Dr. MULLER\nSTRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known\nincident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result\nprobably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,\nMenenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter\nPatriti to Plebei. The change is a serious one. but it would render\nthe passage perfectly clear.] by saying: That they, who deck\nthemselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own.\nThey will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly\nexpress that which I desire to treat of [Footnote 26: _le mie cose\n.... che d\'altra parola_. This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.\nRAVAISSON\'S estimate of L. da Vinci\'s learning.

And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning.

The body of the\natmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating\nstraight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in\nlight and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from\nthe object which produces them the more acute they become and\nalthough in their distribution they intersect and cross they never\nmingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,\nindependently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all\nof equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to\nall. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all\nspace and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,\nin each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.\n\n64.\n\nThe body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids\nproduced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each,\n######################\nOutput:'}

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI. Compare his \'_Essai sur les ouvrages\nphysico-mathématiques de L. da Vinci avec des fragments tirés de ses\nManuscrits, apportés de l\'Italie. Lu a la premiere classe de\nl\'Institut national des Sciences et Arts.\' Paris, An V_ (1797).]\n\nThe practice of perspective (72. 73).\n\n72.\n\nIn the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to\nthe eye.\n\n73.\n\nThe object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that\npupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil.\n\nRefraction of the rays falling upon the eye (74. 75)\n\n74.\n\nThe lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not\nreach the point within the eye in straight lines.\n\n75.\n\nIf the judgment of the eye is situated within it, the straight lines\nof the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through\nthe rarer to the denser medium.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:'}

XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself.

Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere.

Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely.

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another.

Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest.

The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th.

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this and the\npreceding one, No. 9.]\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI am fully concious that, not being a literary man, certain\npresumptuous persons will think that they may reasonably blame me;\nalleging that I am not a man of letters. Foolish folks! do they not\nknow that I might retort as Marius did to the Roman Patricians\n[Footnote 21: _Come Mario disse ai patriti Romani_. "I am unable to\nfind the words here attributed by Leonardo to Marius, either in\nPlutarch\'s Life of Marius or in the Apophthegmata (_Moralia_,\np.202). Nor do they occur in the writings of Valerius Maximus (who\nfrequently mentions Marius) nor in Velleius Paterculus (II, 11 to\n43), Dio Cassius, Aulus Gellius, or Macrobius. Professor E.\nMENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such\npassage is the found in that author" (communication from Dr. MULLER\nSTRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known\nincident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result\nprobably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,\nMenenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter\nPatriti to Plebei. The change is a serious one. but it would render\nthe passage perfectly clear.] by saying: That they, who deck\nthemselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own.\nThey will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly\nexpress that which I desire to treat of [Footnote 26: _le mie cose\n.... che d\'altra parola_. This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.\nRAVAISSON\'S estimate of L. da Vinci\'s learning. "_Leonard de Vinci\netait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans\nl\'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux\nyeux de la posterite._" _Gaz. des Beaux arts. Oct. 1877.]; but they\ndo not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience\nrather than by words [Footnote 28: See Footnote 26]; and\n[experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In\nthis branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those\nmethods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of\nMathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both\n[Footnote: 5.

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di\npittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they\nwill be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. "With regard\nto the passage attributed to Demetrius", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING\nwrites, "I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not\nDemetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius\nPoliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?\nIt may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the\nspirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any\ncorresponding passage either in the \'Fragments\' (C. MULLER, _Orat.\nAtt._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.\nMus._, vol. 29, p. 108)."\n\nThe same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,\napparently as a note for this \'_Proemio_\' thus affording some data\nas to the time where these introductions were written.] declared\nthat he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth\nin words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who\ndesire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that\nof wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.\nFor so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more\nnoble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself. And is repeated, the whole every-where, and the whole in\nevery smallest part. This can be proved by experiment, since if you\nshut a window that faces west and make a hole [Footnote: 6. Here the\ntext breaks off.] . .\n\n[Footnote: Compare LIBRI, _Histoire des sciences mathématiques en\nItalie_. Tome III, p. 43.]\n\nThe function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura (70. 71).\n\n70.\n\nIf the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye, the\neye, on the other hand, sends its image to the object, and no\nportion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off,\nfor any reason either in the eye or the object. Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is\n######################\nOutput:'}

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at.

But you, knowing your errors, will\ncorrect your works and where you find mistakes amend them, and\nremember never to fall into them again. But if you try to apply\nthese rules in composition you will never make an end, and will\nproduce confusion in your works.\n\nThese rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since\ngood judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear\nunderstanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound\nrules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all\nthe sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my\nrules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to\ncriticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a\nwork, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing\nelse.\n\nNecessity of theoretical knowledge (19. 20).\n\n19.\n\nOF THE MISTAKES MADE BY THOSE WHO PRACTISE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThose who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the\nsailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never\ncan be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded\non sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the\ngateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of\ndrawing.\n\n20.\n\nThe painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any\nreason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of\nit without being conscious of their existence.\n\nThe function of the eye (21-23).\n\n21.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.\n\nBehold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\nnote to No. 70.]\n\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.\n\n24.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nVariability of the eye.\n\n1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th.

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI. Compare his \'_Essai sur les ouvrages\nphysico-mathématiques de L. da Vinci avec des fragments tirés de ses\nManuscrits, apportés de l\'Italie. Lu a la premiere classe de\nl\'Institut national des Sciences et Arts.\' Paris, An V_ (1797).]\n\nThe practice of perspective (72. 73).\n\n72.\n\nIn the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to\nthe eye.\n\n73.\n\nThe object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that\npupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil.\n\nRefraction of the rays falling upon the eye (74. 75)\n\n74.\n\nThe lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not\nreach the point within the eye in straight lines.\n\n75.\n\nIf the judgment of the eye is situated within it, the straight lines\nof the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through\nthe rarer to the denser medium.

And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;\nand the moon and the other planets, without suffering any\ndiminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same\nand other perfumes.\n\n61.\n\nAll bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding\nair an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each\ncomplete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body\nwhich produces it.\n\nIt can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,\nall-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in\nitself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images\nof the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation\nthrough which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and\ncause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside\ndown on the dark plane where they are first reflected.

No\nsooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines\nand angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing\nthemselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an\ninfinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each\nopposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion\nequal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of\nthe 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.\n\n63.\n\nEvery body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with\ninfinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused\nin the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.\nEach pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes\nwithin itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same\npower as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of\nvision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at\neach point will see the object of the same size.

And they are all\nof equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to\nall. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all\nspace and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,\nin each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.\n\n64.\n\nThe body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids\nproduced by the objects existing in it.

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator.

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment.

XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself.

Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at.

You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

But you, knowing your errors, will\ncorrect your works and where you find mistakes amend them, and\nremember never to fall into them again. But if you try to apply\nthese rules in composition you will never make an end, and will\nproduce confusion in your works.\n\nThese rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since\ngood judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear\nunderstanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound\nrules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all\nthe sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my\nrules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to\ncriticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a\nwork, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing\nelse.\n\nNecessity of theoretical knowledge (19. 20).\n\n19.\n\nOF THE MISTAKES MADE BY THOSE WHO PRACTISE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThose who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the\nsailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never\ncan be certain whether he is going.

The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another.

And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23. These lines stand between the diagrams I and III.]\n\n[Footnote: 24--53. These lines stand between the diagrams I and II.]\n\n[Footnote: 54--97 are written along the left side of diagram I.]\n\n82.\n\nAn experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from\nits position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their\nplaces.\n\nIf you look at an object at some distance from you and which is\nbelow the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand\nfirmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the\nunder lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you\nwill see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the\nother moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger\non the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile.

All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading\nmatter, absorbs light and heat, and reflects in itself the image of\nthe source of that heat and splendour and, in each minutest portion,\ndoes the same. The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;\nand the moon and the other planets, without suffering any\ndiminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same\nand other perfumes.\n\n61.\n\nAll bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding\nair an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each\ncomplete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body\nwhich produces it.\n\nIt can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,\nall-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in\nitself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images\nof the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation\nthrough which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and\ncause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside\ndown on the dark plane where they are first reflected.

The three\ncircles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which\ntransmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark\nchamber, according to a law which is more fully explained in 75?81.\nSo far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended\nto explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to\ncoalesce at any given spot. In the circles are written,\ngiallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.\n\nThe text breaks off at line 8. The paragraph No.40 follows here in\nthe original MS.]\n\n62.\n\nEvery point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which\ndiverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same\nlines converge to a pyramid [imaging] both the colour and form. No\nsooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines\nand angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing\nthemselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an\ninfinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each\nopposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion\nequal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of\nthe 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.\n\n63.\n\nEvery body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with\ninfinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused\nin the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.\nEach pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes\nwithin itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same\npower as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of\nvision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at\neach point will see the object of the same size. The body of the\natmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating\nstraight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in\nlight and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from\nthe object which produces them the more acute they become and\nalthough in their distribution they intersect and cross they never\nmingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,\nindependently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all\nof equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to\nall. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all\nspace and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,\nin each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.\n\n64.\n\nThe body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids\nproduced by the objects existing in it.

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI. Compare his \'_Essai sur les ouvrages\nphysico-mathématiques de L. da Vinci avec des fragments tirés de ses\nManuscrits, apportés de l\'Italie. Lu a la premiere classe de\nl\'Institut national des Sciences et Arts.\' Paris, An V_ (1797).]\n\nThe practice of perspective (72. 73).\n\n72.\n\nIn the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to\nthe eye.\n\n73.\n\nThe object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that\npupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil.\n\nRefraction of the rays falling upon the eye (74. 75)\n\n74.\n\nThe lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not\nreach the point within the eye in straight lines.\n\n75.\n\nIf the judgment of the eye is situated within it, the straight lines\nof the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through\nthe rarer to the denser medium.

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself.

Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere.

"_Leonard de Vinci\netait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans\nl\'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux\nyeux de la posterite._" _Gaz. des Beaux arts. Oct. 1877.]; but they\ndo not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience\nrather than by words [Footnote 28: See Footnote 26]; and\n[experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In\nthis branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those\nmethods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of\nMathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both\n[Footnote: 5. Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader.

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

Practice must always be founded\non sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the\ngateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of\ndrawing.\n\n20.\n\nThe painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any\nreason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of\nit without being conscious of their existence.\n\nThe function of the eye (21-23).\n\n21.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.\n\nBehold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\nnote to No. 70.]\n\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.\n\n24.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nVariability of the eye.\n\n1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours\n######################\nOutput:'}

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at. And remember that the eye _\n######################\nOutput:'}

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23. These lines stand between the diagrams I and III.]\n\n[Footnote: 24--53. These lines stand between the diagrams I and II.]\n\n[Footnote: 54--97 are written along the left side of diagram I.]\n\n82.\n\nAn experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from\nits position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their\nplaces.\n\nIf you look at an object at some distance from you and which is\nbelow the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand\nfirmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the\nunder lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you\nwill see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the\nother moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger\non the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI. Compare his \'_Essai sur les ouvrages\nphysico-mathématiques de L. da Vinci avec des fragments tirés de ses\nManuscrits, apportés de l\'Italie. Lu a la premiere classe de\nl\'Institut national des Sciences et Arts.\' Paris, An V_ (1797).]\n\nThe practice of perspective (72. 73).\n\n72.\n\nIn the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to\nthe eye.\n\n73.\n\nThe object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that\npupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil.\n\nRefraction of the rays falling upon the eye (74. 75)\n\n74.\n\nThe lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not\nreach the point within the eye in straight lines.\n\n75.\n\nIf the judgment of the eye is situated within it, the straight lines\nof the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through\nthe rarer to the denser medium. If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace\n######################\nOutput:'}

We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di\npittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they\nwill be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. "With regard\nto the passage attributed to Demetrius", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING\nwrites, "I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not\nDemetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius\nPoliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?\nIt may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the\nspirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any\ncorresponding passage either in the \'Fragments\' (C. MULLER, _Orat.\nAtt._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.\nMus._, vol. 29, p. 108)."\n\nThe same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,\napparently as a note for this \'_Proemio_\' thus affording some data\nas to the time where these introductions were written.] declared\nthat he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth\nin words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who\ndesire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that\nof wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.\nFor so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more\nnoble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:'}

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

Then [again] bring it closer to the eye and you will see the rod\nproject far beyond the image of the tower from _a_ to _b_ and from\n_t_ to _b_, and so you will discern that, a little farther within,\nthe lines must converge in a point.\n\nThe Production of pyramid of Vision (58-60).\n\n58.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe instant the atmosphere is illuminated it will be filled with an\ninfinite number of images which are produced by the various bodies\nand colours assembled in it. And the eye is the target, a loadstone,\nof these images.\n\n59.\n\nThe whole surface of opaque bodies displays its whole image in all\nthe illuminated atmosphere which surrounds them on all sides.\n\n60.\n\nThat the atmosphere attracts to itself, like a loadstone, all the\nimages of the objects that exist in it, and not their forms merely\nbut their nature may be clearly seen by the sun, which is a hot and\nluminous body. All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading\nmatter, absorbs light and heat, and reflects in itself the image of\nthe source of that heat and splendour and, in each minutest portion,\ndoes the same. The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;\nand the moon and the other planets, without suffering any\ndiminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same\nand other perfumes.\n\n61.\n\nAll bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding\nair an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each\ncomplete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body\nwhich produces it.\n\nIt can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,\nall-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in\nitself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images\nof the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation\nthrough which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and\ncause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside\ndown on the dark plane where they are first reflected. The reason of\nthis is--\n\n[Footnote: The diagram intended to illustrate the statement (Pl. II\nNo. i) occurs in the original between lines 3 and 4. The three\ncircles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which\ntransmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark\nchamber, according to a law which is more fully explained in 75?81.\nSo far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended\nto explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to\ncoalesce at any given spot. In the circles are written,\ngiallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.\n\nThe text breaks off at line 8. The paragraph No.40 follows here in\nthe original MS.]\n\n62.\n\nEvery point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which\ndiverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same\nlines converge to a pyramid [imaging] both the colour and form. No\nsooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines\nand angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing\nthemselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an\ninfinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each\nopposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion\nequal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of\nthe 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.\n\n63.\n\nEvery body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with\ninfinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused\nin the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.\nEach pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes\nwithin itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same\npower as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of\nvision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at\neach point will see the object of the same size. The body of the\natmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating\nstraight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in\nlight and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from\nthe object which produces them the more acute they become and\nalthough in their distribution they intersect and cross they never\nmingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,\nindependently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all\nof equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to\nall. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all\nspace and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,\nin each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.\n\n64.\n\nThe body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids\nproduced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each,\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself. And is repeated, the whole every-where, and the whole in\nevery smallest part. This can be proved by experiment, since if you\nshut a window that faces west and make a hole [Footnote: 6. Here the\ntext breaks off.] . .\n\n[Footnote: Compare LIBRI, _Histoire des sciences mathématiques en\nItalie_. Tome III, p. 43.]\n\nThe function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura (70. 71).\n\n70.\n\nIf the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye, the\neye, on the other hand, sends its image to the object, and no\nportion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off,\nfor any reason either in the eye or the object. Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is\n######################\nOutput:'}

Foolish folks! do they not\nknow that I might retort as Marius did to the Roman Patricians\n[Footnote 21: _Come Mario disse ai patriti Romani_. "I am unable to\nfind the words here attributed by Leonardo to Marius, either in\nPlutarch\'s Life of Marius or in the Apophthegmata (_Moralia_,\np.202). Nor do they occur in the writings of Valerius Maximus (who\nfrequently mentions Marius) nor in Velleius Paterculus (II, 11 to\n43), Dio Cassius, Aulus Gellius, or Macrobius. Professor E.\nMENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such\npassage is the found in that author" (communication from Dr. MULLER\nSTRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known\nincident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result\nprobably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,\nMenenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter\nPatriti to Plebei. The change is a serious one. but it would render\nthe passage perfectly clear.] by saying: That they, who deck\nthemselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own.\nThey will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly\nexpress that which I desire to treat of [Footnote 26: _le mie cose\n.... che d\'altra parola_. This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.\nRAVAISSON\'S estimate of L. da Vinci\'s learning. "_Leonard de Vinci\netait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans\nl\'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux\nyeux de la posterite._" _Gaz. des Beaux arts. Oct. 1877.]; but they\ndo not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience\nrather than by words [Footnote 28: See Footnote 26]; and\n[experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In\nthis branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those\nmethods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of\nMathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both\n[Footnote: 5.

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:'}

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

But if you try to apply\nthese rules in composition you will never make an end, and will\nproduce confusion in your works.\n\nThese rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since\ngood judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear\nunderstanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound\nrules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all\nthe sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my\nrules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to\ncriticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a\nwork, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing\nelse.\n\nNecessity of theoretical knowledge (19. 20).\n\n19.\n\nOF THE MISTAKES MADE BY THOSE WHO PRACTISE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThose who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the\nsailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never\ncan be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded\non sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the\ngateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of\ndrawing.\n\n20.\n\nThe painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any\nreason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of\nit without being conscious of their existence.\n\nThe function of the eye (21-23).\n\n21.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.\n\nBehold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\nnote to No. 70.]\n\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.\n\n24.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nVariability of the eye.\n\n1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours\n######################\nOutput:'}

And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23.

These lines stand between the diagrams I and II.]\n\n[Footnote: 54--97 are written along the left side of diagram I.]\n\n82.\n\nAn experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from\nits position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their\nplaces.\n\nIf you look at an object at some distance from you and which is\nbelow the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand\nfirmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the\nunder lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you\nwill see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the\nother moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger\non the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind.

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at.

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di\npittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they\nwill be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. "With regard\nto the passage attributed to Demetrius", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING\nwrites, "I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not\nDemetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius\nPoliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?\nIt may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the\nspirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any\ncorresponding passage either in the \'Fragments\' (C. MULLER, _Orat.\nAtt._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.\nMus._, vol. 29, p. 108)."\n\nThe same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,\napparently as a note for this \'_Proemio_\' thus affording some data\nas to the time where these introductions were written.] declared\nthat he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth\nin words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who\ndesire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that\nof wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.\nFor so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more\nnoble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:'}

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself.

Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere.

"_Leonard de Vinci\netait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans\nl\'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux\nyeux de la posterite._" _Gaz. des Beaux arts. Oct. 1877.]; but they\ndo not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience\nrather than by words [Footnote 28: See Footnote 26]; and\n[experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In\nthis branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those\nmethods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of\nMathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both\n[Footnote: 5. Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader.

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon.

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:'}

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them. But you, knowing your errors, will\ncorrect your works and where you find mistakes amend them, and\nremember never to fall into them again. But if you try to apply\nthese rules in composition you will never make an end, and will\nproduce confusion in your works.\n\nThese rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since\ngood judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear\nunderstanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound\nrules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all\nthe sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my\nrules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to\ncriticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a\nwork, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing\nelse.\n\nNecessity of theoretical knowledge (19. 20).\n\n19.\n\nOF THE MISTAKES MADE BY THOSE WHO PRACTISE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThose who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the\nsailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never\ncan be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded\non sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the\ngateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of\ndrawing.\n\n20.\n\nThe painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any\nreason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of\nit without being conscious of their existence.\n\nThe function of the eye (21-23).\n\n21.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.\n\nBehold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\nnote to No. 70.]\n\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.\n\n24.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nVariability of the eye.\n\n1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th.

In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo\'s mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at. And remember that the eye _\n######################\nOutput:'}

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI.

But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23. These lines stand between the diagrams I and III.]\n\n[Footnote: 24--53. These lines stand between the diagrams I and II.]\n\n[Footnote: 54--97 are written along the left side of diagram I.]\n\n82.\n\nAn experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from\nits position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their\nplaces.\n\nIf you look at an object at some distance from you and which is\nbelow the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand\nfirmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the\nunder lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you\nwill see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the\nother moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger\non the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one.

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees.

We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile.

And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:'}

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

Then [again] bring it closer to the eye and you will see the rod\nproject far beyond the image of the tower from _a_ to _b_ and from\n_t_ to _b_, and so you will discern that, a little farther within,\nthe lines must converge in a point.\n\nThe Production of pyramid of Vision (58-60).\n\n58.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe instant the atmosphere is illuminated it will be filled with an\ninfinite number of images which are produced by the various bodies\nand colours assembled in it. And the eye is the target, a loadstone,\nof these images.\n\n59.\n\nThe whole surface of opaque bodies displays its whole image in all\nthe illuminated atmosphere which surrounds them on all sides.\n\n60.\n\nThat the atmosphere attracts to itself, like a loadstone, all the\nimages of the objects that exist in it, and not their forms merely\nbut their nature may be clearly seen by the sun, which is a hot and\nluminous body. All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading\nmatter, absorbs light and heat, and reflects in itself the image of\nthe source of that heat and splendour and, in each minutest portion,\ndoes the same. The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;\nand the moon and the other planets, without suffering any\ndiminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same\nand other perfumes.\n\n61.\n\nAll bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding\nair an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each\ncomplete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body\nwhich produces it.\n\nIt can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,\nall-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in\nitself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images\nof the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation\nthrough which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and\ncause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside\ndown on the dark plane where they are first reflected. The reason of\nthis is--\n\n[Footnote: The diagram intended to illustrate the statement (Pl. II\nNo. i) occurs in the original between lines 3 and 4. The three\ncircles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which\ntransmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark\nchamber, according to a law which is more fully explained in 75?81.\nSo far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended\nto explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to\ncoalesce at any given spot. In the circles are written,\ngiallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.\n\nThe text breaks off at line 8. The paragraph No.40 follows here in\nthe original MS.]\n\n62.\n\nEvery point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which\ndiverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same\nlines converge to a pyramid [imaging] both the colour and form. No\nsooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines\nand angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing\nthemselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an\ninfinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each\nopposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion\nequal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of\nthe 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.\n\n63.\n\nEvery body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with\ninfinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused\nin the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.\nEach pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes\nwithin itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same\npower as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of\nvision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at\neach point will see the object of the same size. The body of the\natmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating\nstraight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in\nlight and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from\nthe object which produces them the more acute they become and\nalthough in their distribution they intersect and cross they never\nmingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,\nindependently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all\nof equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to\nall. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all\nspace and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,\nin each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.\n\n64.\n\nThe body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids\nproduced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each,\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should\nalways diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye\nthe base and the apex of a pyramid. This being the case, if the eye\nconsisted of a million worlds, it would not prevent its being\nconsumed in the projection of its virtue; and if this virtue would\nhave to travel through the air as perfumes do, the winds would bent\nit and carry it into another place. But we do [in fact] see the mass\nof the sun with the same rapidity as [an object] at the distance of\na braccio, and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of\nthe winds nor by any other accident.\n\n[Footnote: The view here refuted by Leonardo was maintained among\nothers by Bramantino, Leonardo\'s Milanese contemporary. LOMAZZO\nwrites as follows in his Trattato dell\' Arte della pittura &c.\n(Milano 1584. Libr. V cp. XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself. And is repeated, the whole every-where, and the whole in\nevery smallest part. This can be proved by experiment, since if you\nshut a window that faces west and make a hole [Footnote: 6. Here the\ntext breaks off.] . .\n\n[Footnote: Compare LIBRI, _Histoire des sciences mathématiques en\nItalie_. Tome III, p. 43.]\n\nThe function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura (70. 71).\n\n70.\n\nIf the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye, the\neye, on the other hand, sends its image to the object, and no\nportion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off,\nfor any reason either in the eye or the object. Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is\n######################\nOutput:'}

Professor E.\nMENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such\npassage is the found in that author" (communication from Dr. MULLER\nSTRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known\nincident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result\nprobably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,\nMenenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter\nPatriti to Plebei.

This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.\nRAVAISSON\'S estimate of L. da Vinci\'s learning.

They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator.

There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:'}

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space.

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}

The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d\'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara più distante dall\' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:'}

If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace; and the same with objects under water seen from the air.\n\nThe intersection of the rays (76-82).\n\n76.\n\nThe inversion of the images.\n\nAll the images of objects which pass through a window [glass pane]\nfrom the free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen\non the opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air\nfrom east to west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is\nlighted by this confined air, to have an opposite motion.\n\n77.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE IMAGES OF BODIES PASS IN BETWEEN THE\nMARGINS OF THE OPENINGS BY WHICH THEY ENTER.\n\nWhat difference is there in the way in which images pass through\nnarrow openings and through large openings, or in those which pass\nby the sides of shaded bodies? By moving the edges of the opening\nthrough which the images are admitted, the images of immovable\nobjects are made to move. And this happens, as is shown in the 9th\nwhich demonstrates: [Footnote 11: _per la 9a che dicie_. When\nLeonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal\ndiagrams; this can in some instances be distinctly proved. The ninth\nsketch on the page W. L. 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of\nthe three reproduced.] the images of any object are all everywhere,\nand all in each part of the surrounding air. It follows that if one\nof the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark\nchamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in\ncontact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were\nremote from it &c.\n\nOF THE MOVEMENT OF THE EDGE AT THE RIGHT OR LEFT, OR THE UPPER, OR\nLOWER EDGE.\n\nIf you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will\nmove [being that] of the object which entered on the right side of\nthe opening; and the same result will happen with all the other\nsides of the opening. This can be proved by the 2nd of this which\nshows: all the rays which convey the images of objects through the\nair are straight lines. Hence, if the images of very large bodies\nhave to pass through very small holes, and beyond these holes\nrecover their large size, the lines must necessarily intersect.\n\n[Footnote: 77. 2. In the first of the three diagrams Leonardo had\ndrawn only one of the two margins, et _m_.]\n\n78.\n\nNecessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of\nthe eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is\nin the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were\nnot the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as\nit does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do\nso in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their\nsurface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the\ndefinition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to\na point; for _smallest_ is said of that than which nothing can be\nsmaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the\npoint. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle\nto transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in\nthe 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images\ncross each other without interfering with each other. These\ndemonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the\nsmallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;\nbut as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more\nreversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within\nthe eye as that of the object outside the eye.\n\n79.\n\nOF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.\n\nOnly one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual\nvirtue, has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions\nbecause it is a mathematical line which originates from a\nmathematical point, which has no dimensions.\n\nAccording to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line\nof every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark\nchamber shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the\nbodies that surround it.\n\n80.\n\nAS TO WHETHER THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE IMAGE CAN BE INTERSECTED, OR\nNOT, WITHIN THE OPENING.\n\nIt is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,\nthat its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left\nside become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two\nlines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to\nleft or from left to right in itself without such extension and\nthickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is\n######################\nOutput:'}

But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of "photogravure". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l\'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo\'s; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the "photo-gravures" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:'}

Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader. They are however but few.]. But its axioms being laid\ndown at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,\narranging them on the method both of their natural order and of\nmathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects\nfrom the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;\nadding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in\nthem, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who\nis the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat\nof Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts\n[Footnote: 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by\nVITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by\nall the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not\nregarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest\napplication the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two\nsciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus\nwe find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to\nthis arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the\n_libro di pittura_ propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand\nside by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter\ndeals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words _partirò\nla presente opera in 3 parti_ may refer to the same division into\nthree sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.].\n\nThe plan of the book on Painting (14--17).\n\n14.\n\nON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere are three branches of perspective; the first deals with the\nreasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede from\nthe eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second\ncontains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye.\nThe third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the\nobjects [in a picture] ought to be less finished in proportion as\nthey are remote (and the names are as follows):\n\nLinear Perspective. The Perspective of Colour. The Perspective of\nDisappearance.\n\n[Footnote: 13. From the character of the handwriting I infer that\nthis passage was written before the year 1490.].\n\n15.\n\nON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these,\nthe first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the\nsecond treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque\nobjects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long\ndistances.\n\n[Footnote: The division is here the same as in the previous chapter\nNo. 14, and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact\nthat a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the\nwriting of the two passages.]\n\n16.\n\nTHE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal\nsections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of\nbodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats\nof the diminution in colour in these objects. The third [deals with]\nthe diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by\nthe objects at various distances.\n\n17.\n\nON THE SECTIONS OF [THE BOOK ON] PAINTING.\n\nThe first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should\nappear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different\ndistances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground\nof the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:\nthe diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the\ndiminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.\nAnd of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the\nstructure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the\natmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by\nit. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due\nvariety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like\nbrothers, &c.\n\n[Footnote: This and the two foregoing chapters must have been\nwritten in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which\nLeonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on\nPerspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is\nan evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that\nLeonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so\nearly as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,\nmust have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,\nby the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: _Das Buch van\nder Malerei_. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).]\n\nThe use of the book on Painting.\n\n18.\n\nThese rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every\nman makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows\nthem not, cannot amend them.

Practice must always be founded\non sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the\ngateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of\ndrawing.\n\n20.\n\nThe painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any\nreason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of\nit without being conscious of their existence.\n\nThe function of the eye (21-23).\n\n21.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.\n\nBehold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our\nforefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and\nLife are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at\nany time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for\nmany ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we\nso certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been\ndefined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,\nby experience, that it is quite another. [Footnote 13: Compare the\nnote to No. 70.]\n\n[Footnote: In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study\nof Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions\nof the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his\nastronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b \'_Ordine del\nprovare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l\'occhio\'_,\n&c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical\nperspective.]\n\n22.\n\nHere [in the eye] forms, here colours, here the character of every\npart of the universe are concentrated to a point; and that point is\nso marvellous a thing ... Oh! marvellous, O stupendous Necessity--by\nthy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of\nits cause, by the shortest path. These [indeed] are miracles;...\n\nIn so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole\nexpanse. Describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between\nthe diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from\nthem of the crystalline lens.\n\n23.\n\nOF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.\n\nPainting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which\nare:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,\nDistance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine\nwill be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the\npainter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to\nimitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.\n\n24.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nVariability of the eye.\n\n1st. The pupil of the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase\nof light which is reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands\nin proportion to the diminution in the day light, or any other\nlight, that is reflected in it. 3rd. [Footnote: 8. The subject of\nthis third proposition we find fully discussed in MS. G. 44a.]. The\neye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater\nintensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and\nthis can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats,\nand certain birds--as the owl and others--in which the pupil varies\nin a high degree from large to small, &c., when in the dark or in\nthe light. 4th. The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours\n######################\nOutput:'}

And if there is extension it is\nno longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the\nproperties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having\nno centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the\nline can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by\nthe movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e\nf_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move\nthe line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the\nspot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each\nother at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn\nthe straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of\nthese two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you\nimagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by\nthis motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal\nwith it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this\nis sufficient to prove our proposition.\n\n81.\n\nHOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A\nPOINT.\n\nJust as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each\nother--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the\nimages of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the\nobject opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the\nconverging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge\nagain beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that\nimage. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in\nthe first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it\nenters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.\n\nRead the marginal text on the other side.\n\nIn proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so\nmuch less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect\neach other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a\ndark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in\nproportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an\nobject in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image\nof its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as\nthis shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has\nbeen proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the\nopening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller\nthan the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your\nleft hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the\nright opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_\n_b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs\nhalf way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.\nBut this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_\nbeing much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.\n\nIt is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between\nthe objects and the openings through which the images of these\nbodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere\nis illuminated these images are not formed visibly.\n\nWhen the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they\nare invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_\nbe such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space\nbetween the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being\nseen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_\n_b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.\n\n[Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this\nchapter Leonardo has written "_azurro_" (blue) where in the\nfacsimile I have marked _A_, and "_giallo_" (yellow) where _B_\nstands.]\n\n[Footnote: 15--23. These lines stand between the diagrams I and III.]\n\n[Footnote: 24--53. These lines stand between the diagrams I and II.]\n\n[Footnote: 54--97 are written along the left side of diagram I.]\n\n82.\n\nAn experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from\nits position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their\nplaces.\n\nIf you look at an object at some distance from you and which is\nbelow the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand\nfirmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the\nunder lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you\nwill see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the\nother moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger\non the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17.

All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller.

Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22).

But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere. That is: the whole object in the whole atmosphere, and\nin each part; and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of\nthem in each part; speaking of that atmosphere which is able to\ncontain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images\nprojected by the objects. From this it seems necessary to admit that\nit is in the nature of the atmosphere, which subsists between the\nobjects, and which attracts the images of things to itself like a\nloadstone, being placed between them.\n\nPROVE HOW ALL OBJECTS, PLACED IN ONE POSITION, ARE ALL EVERYWHERE\nAND ALL IN EACH PART.\n\nI say that if the front of a building--or any open piazza or\nfield--which is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to\nit, and if, in the front which does not face the sun, you make a\nsmall round hole, all the illuminated objects will project their\nimages through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the\nopposite wall which may be made white; and there, in fact, they will\nbe upside down, and if you make similar openings in several places\nin the same wall you will have the same result from each. Hence the\nimages of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall\nand all in each minutest part of it. The reason, as we clearly know,\nis that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling, and\nthe light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous\nbodies. If these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays\nforming the images are of various colours and shapes, and so will\nthe representations be on the wall.\n\n[Footnote: 70. 15--23. This section has already been published in the\n"_Saggio delle Opere di Leonardo da Vinci_" Milan 1872, pp. 13, 14.\nG. Govi observes upon it, that Leonardo is not to be regarded as the\ninventor of the Camera obscura, but that he was the first to explain\nby it the structure of the eye. An account of the Camera obscura\nfirst occurs in CESARE CESARINI\'s Italian version of Vitruvius, pub.\n1523, four years after Leonardo\'s death. Cesarini expressly names\nBenedettino Don Papnutio as the inventor of the Camera obscura. In\nhis explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the\nCamera obscura Leonardo was the precursor of G. CARDANO, Professor\nof Medicine at Bologna (died 1576) and it appears highly probable\nthat this is, in fact, the very discovery which Leonardo ascribes to\nhimself in section 21 without giving any further details.]\n\n71.\n\nHOW THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS RECEIVED BY THE EYE INTERSECT WITHIN THE\nCRYSTALLINE HUMOUR OF THE EYE.\n\nAn experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or\npictures, intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour, is\nseen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of\nilluminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these\nimages on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near\nto the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their\nproper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside\ndown by reason of that very intersection. These images being\ntransmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually\npainted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at\nfrom behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin\nplate of iron. Let _a b e d e_ be the object illuminated by the sun\nand _o r_ the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at\n_n m_. Let _s t_ be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the\nimages of these objects upside down, because the rays being\nstraight, _a_ on the right hand becomes _k_ on the left, and _e_ on\nthe left becomes _f_ on the right; and the same takes place inside\nthe pupil.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter is already known through a translation into\nFrench by VENTURI. Compare his \'_Essai sur les ouvrages\nphysico-mathématiques de L. da Vinci avec des fragments tirés de ses\nManuscrits, apportés de l\'Italie. Lu a la premiere classe de\nl\'Institut national des Sciences et Arts.\' Paris, An V_ (1797).]\n\nThe practice of perspective (72. 73).\n\n72.\n\nIn the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to\nthe eye.\n\n73.\n\nThe object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that\npupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil.\n\nRefraction of the rays falling upon the eye (74. 75)\n\n74.\n\nThe lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not\nreach the point within the eye in straight lines.\n\n75.\n\nIf the judgment of the eye is situated within it, the straight lines\nof the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through\nthe rarer to the denser medium. If, when you are under water, you\nlook at objects in the air you will see them out of their true\nplace\n######################\nOutput:'}

The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:'}

We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of \'_li tua libri di notomia_\', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo\'s notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this \'Proemio\' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di\npittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they\nwill be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. "With regard\nto the passage attributed to Demetrius", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING\nwrites, "I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not\nDemetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius\nPoliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?\nIt may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the\nspirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any\ncorresponding passage either in the \'Fragments\' (C. MULLER, _Orat.\nAtt._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.\nMus._, vol. 29, p. 108)."\n\nThe same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,\napparently as a note for this \'_Proemio_\' thus affording some data\nas to the time where these introductions were written.] declared\nthat he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth\nin words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who\ndesire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that\nof wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.\nFor so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more\nnoble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè\ndell\'uffitio dell\'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:'}

These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth\'s time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:'}

And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the "Pyramid of Sight" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the "Pyramid of Sight" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo\'s in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:'}

A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think that the publication of the texts in the order in which\nthey occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No\nreader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself\ncould not have done it.\n\nAdded to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages\nwhich now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present\narranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of\nthe collector who first brought them together to make volumes of\nmore or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which\nwere numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the\nconnection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of\nindifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,\nwhen first writing down his notes, was that each observation should\nbe complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The\nexceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly\nnoteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his\nnumbered pages, the written observations: "turn over", "This is the\ncontinuation of the previous page", and the like. Is not this\nsufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that\nthe writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when\nhe should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his\nwritings?\n\nWhat this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases\nindicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this\nauthoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from\nthis are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate\nparagraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is\nquite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the\nscattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to\nstate that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due\nexecution of this responsible task.\n\nThe beginning of Leonardo\'s literary labours dates from about his\nthirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without\nany serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that\nremain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space\nof time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to\njudge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,\nindeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year\nis incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has\nnot been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these\nafford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is\ngenerally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original\nManuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the\norder of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly\nimportant to be able to verify the time and place at which certain\nobservations were made and registered. For this purpose the\nBibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be\nregarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s\nliterary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)\nat the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical\nsequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and\nfigures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original\nManuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage\nis to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of\nManuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at\nthe end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not\nmerely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly\nwhere it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the\nsequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may\nreconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the\nvarious texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,\nthat is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of\nthis work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s\nManuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great\nnumber of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some\nother subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt\nwith by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these\nwritings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.\n\nIn 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection\nfrom Leonardo\'s writings on painting, and this treatise became so\npopular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,\nand in six different languages. But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo\'s text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo\'s essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig\n######################\nOutput:'}

XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi\nscritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,\nattenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi\nintessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l\'opinione\ndi cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive\nBramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e\nche ciò si fa in tre modi\n\nCirca il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in\npoche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non\npotersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al\nfine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima\nprospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di\npunto, e l\'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima\nsi dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l\'effetto dell\'\nocchio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.\nQuesto crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se\nper esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può\ncrescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali\nsono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che\nmandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta\nlarghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a\nquella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito\nfino all\' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.\n\nIt is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting\nthis view, at Milan in 1492]\n\n69.\n\nA parallel case.\n\nJust as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of\nmany circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so\nany object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in\ncircles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of\nitself.

Therefore we may\nrather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous\natmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it,\nthan the nature of the objects, to send their images through the\nair. If the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the\neye, the eye would have to do the same to the object, whence it\nmight seem that these images were an emanation. But, if so, it would\nbe necessary [to admit] that every object became rapidly smaller;\nbecause each object appears by its images in the surrounding\natmosphere.

"_Leonard de Vinci\netait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans\nl\'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux\nyeux de la posterite._" _Gaz. des Beaux arts. Oct. 1877.]; but they\ndo not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience\nrather than by words [Footnote 28: See Footnote 26]; and\n[experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,\nas mistress, I will cite her in all cases.\n\n11.\n\nThough I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall\nrely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,\nthe mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,\ndressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,\nbut of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will\nscorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not\ninventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be\nblamed.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nAnd those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and\nMan, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of\nothers, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the\nobject in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in\nthe mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other\nnothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by\nchance that they wear the human form and without it I might class\nthem with the herds of beasts.\n\n12.\n\nMany will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my\nproofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the\nhighest reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering\nthat my works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is\nthe one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to\nknow the true from the false--and this aids men to look only for\nthings that are possible and with due moderation--and not to wrap\nyourself in ignorance, a thing which can have no good result, so\nthat in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy.\n\n13.\n\nAmong all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly\ndelights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics\nthe certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)\nelevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must\nbe preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In\nthis branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those\nmethods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of\nMathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both\n[Footnote: 5. Such of Leonardo\'s notes on Optics or on Perspective\nas bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included\nin the arrangement of the _libro di pittura_ which is here presented\nto the reader.

As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years\' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that "he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo\'s\ngenius:\n\n"Majestati naturae par ingenium."\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.

How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter\'s point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter\'s plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c\'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon.

It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist\'s point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays "just as a magnet\nattracts iron".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _"Trattato d\'Architettura civile e\nmilitare"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _\'In prima he da sapere che punto è quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza àpieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:'}

And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n"By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man\'s eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.

Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:'}

Two of the three most important\nwere never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,\nwhich obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza\nMonument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the\nthird--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered\nirremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to\nwhich it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth\ncenturies. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has\nbecome so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.\n\nVasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, "that he laboured\nmuch more by his word than in fact or by deed", and the biographer\nevidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which\nhave been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost\ninexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts\nshould have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It\nis certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their\nexceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely\nby the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional\ninterest which has been attached to the change of ownership of\nmerely a few pages of Manuscript.\n\nThat, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,\ntheir contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the\nmany and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.\nThe handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable\npractice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve\nwith any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative\nreadings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari\nobserves with reference to Leonardos writing: "he wrote backwards,\nin rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is\nnot practised in reading them, cannot understand them". The aid of a\nmirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only\nfor a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,\nthe persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be\npractically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts\nto be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo\'s handwriting runs\nbackwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is\nto say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the\nwriting is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing\nis not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of\nmastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to\nhimself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into\none long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long\nword into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation\nwhatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,\nnor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such\ndifficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a\ndesperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the\ngood intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should\nhave failed.\n\nLeonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of\nScience were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical\nmethod is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations\nand dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is\nconsequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is\nmuch to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged\nthem. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the\nreason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs\nappear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,\nobservations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other\nwithout any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some\nprinciples of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the\nlaws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page\nwill begin with his investigations on the structure of the\nintestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations\nof poetry to painting; and so forth.\n\nLeonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do\nnot think\n######################\nOutput:'}
