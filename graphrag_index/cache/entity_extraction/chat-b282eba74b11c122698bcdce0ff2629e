XCIX, No. 2 (MS. S. K. III, No. 36a) a small plan of the whole\nedifice.--The projecting chapels in the middle of the transept are\nwanting here.

These buttresses correspond exactly with\nthose described by Bramante as existing in the model presented by\nOmodeo. [Footnote: Bramante's opinion was first published by G.\nMONGERl, Arch. stor. Lomb. V, fasc. 3 and afterwards by me in the\npublication mentioned in the preceding note.]\n\nPl. C, 3 (MS. Tr. 16).
