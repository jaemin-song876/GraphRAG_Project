I may refer here to some data given by_ LIBRI,\nHistoire des sciences mathematiques en Italie (II, 216, 217): \"On a\ncru dans ces derniers temps faire un miracle en mecanique en\neffectuant ce transport, et cependant des l'annee 1455, Gaspard Nadi\net Aristote de Fioravantio avaient transporte, a une distance\nconsiderable, la tour de la Magione de Bologne, avec ses fondements,\nqui avait presque quatre-vingts pieds de haut. Le continuateur de la\nchronique de Pugliola dit que le trajet fut de 35 pieds et que\ndurant le transport auquel le chroniqueur affirme avoir assiste, il\narriva un accident grave qui fit pencher de trois pieds la tour\npendant qu'elle etait suspendue, mais que cet accident fut\npromptement repare (Muratori, Scriptores rer. ital. Tom. XVIII, col.\n717, 718). Alidosi a rapporte une note ou Nadi rend compte de ce\ntransport avec une rare simplicite. D'apres cette note, on voit que\nles operations de ce genre n'etaient pas nouvelles. Celle-ci ne\ncouta que 150 livres (monnaie d'alors) y compris le cadeau que le\nLegat fit aux deux mecaniciens. Dans la meme annee, Aristote\nredressa le clocher de Cento, qui penchait de plus de cinq pieds\n(Alidosi, instruttione p. 188-- Muratori, Scriptores rer. ital.,\ntom. XXIII, col. 888.--Bossii, chronica Mediol., 1492, in-fol. ad\nann. 1455). On ne concoit pas comment les historiens des beaux-arts\nont pu negliger de tels hommes.\" J. P. R.]\n\n_In the MS. C. A. fol. 293, there are two sketches which possibly\nmight have a bearing on this bold enterprise. We find there a plan\nof a circular or polygonal edifice surrounded by semicircular arches\nin an oblique position. These may be taken for the foundation of the\nsteps and of the new platform. In the perspective elevation the same\nedifice, forming a polygon, is shown as lifted up and resting on a\ncircle of inverted arches which rest on an other circle of arches in\nthe ordinary position, but so placed that the inverted arches above\nrest on the spandrels of the lower range._\n\n_What seems to confirm the supposition that the lifting up of a\nbuilding is here in question, is the indication of engines for\nwinding up, such as jacks, and a rack and wheel. As the lifting\napparatus represented on this sheet does not seem particularly\napplicable to an undertaking of such magnitude, we may consider it\nto be a first sketch or scheme for the engines to be used._\n\n_G. Description of an unknown Temple._\n\n759.\n\nTwelve flights of steps led up to the great temple, which was eight\nhundred braccia in circumference and built on an octagonal plan. At\nthe eight corners were eight large plinths, one braccia and a half\nhigh, and three wide, and six long at the bottom, with an angle in\nthe middle; on these were eight great pillars, standing on the\nplinths as a foundation, and twenty four braccia high. And on the\ntop of these were eight capitals three braccia long and six wide,\nabove which were the architrave frieze and cornice, four braccia and\na half high, and this was carried on in a straight line from one\npillar to the next and so, continuing for eight hundred braccia,\nsurrounded the whole temple, from pillar to pillar. To support this\nentablature there were ten large columns of the same height as the\npillars, three braccia thick above their bases which were one\nbraccia and a half high.\n\nThe ascent to this temple was by twelve flights of steps, and the\ntemple was on the twelfth, of an octagonal form, and at each angle\nrose a large pillar; and between the pillars were placed ten columns\nof the same height as the pillars, rising at once from the pavement\nto a height of twenty eight braccia and a half; and at this height\nthe architrave, frieze and cornice were placed which surrounded the\ntemple having a length of eight hundred braccia. At the same height,\nand within the temple at the same level, and all round the centre of\nthe temple at a distance of 24 braccia farther in, are pillars\ncorresponding to the eight pillars in the angles, and columns\ncorresponding to those placed in the outer spaces. These rise to the\nsame height as the former ones, and over these the continuous\narchitrave returns towards the outer row of pillars and columns.\n\n[Footnote: Either this description is incomplete, or, as seems to me\nhighly probable, it refers to some ruin. The enormous dimensions\nforbid our supposing this to be any temple in Italy or Greece. Syria\nwas the native land of colossal octagonal buildings, in the early\ncenturies A. D. The Temple of Baalbek, and others are even larger\nthan that here described. J. P. R.]\n\n_V.
