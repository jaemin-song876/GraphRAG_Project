This is proved by the 7th of this which says\nthat a tree looks darkest when it is seen from below; the\nproposition is verified, since this hill will, on its upper half\nshow all its trees as much from the side which is lighted by the\nlight of the sky, as from that which is in shade from the darkness\nof the earth; whence it must result that these trees are of a medium\ndarkness. And from this [middle] spot towards the base of the hill,\nthese trees will be lighter by degrees by the converse of the 7th\nand by the said 7th: For trees so placed, the nearer they are to the\nsummit of the hill the darker they necessarily become. But this\ndarkness is not in proportion to the distance, by the 8th of this\nwhich says: That object shows darkest which is [seen] in the\nclearest atmosphere; and by the 10th: That shows darkest which\nstands out against a lighter background.\n\n[Footnote: The quotation in this passage again cannot be verified.]\n\n463.\n\nOF LANDSCAPES.\n\nThe colours of the shadows in mountains at a great distance take a\nmost lovely blue, much purer than their illuminated portions. And\nfrom this it follows that when the rock of a mountain is reddish the\nilluminated portions are violet (?) and the more they are lighted\nthe more they display their proper colour.\n\n464.\n\nA place is most luminous when it is most remote from mountains.\n\nOn the treatment of light for views of towns (465-469).\n\n465.\n\nOF LIGHT AND SHADOW IN A TOWN.\n\nWhen the sun is in the East and the eye is above the centre of a\ntown, the eye will see the Southern part of the town with its roofs\nhalf in shade and half in light, and the same towards the North; the\nEastern side will be all in shadow and the Western will be all in\nlight.\n\n466.\n\nOf the houses of a town, in which the divisions between the houses\nmay be distinguished by the light which fall on the mist at the\nbottom. If the eye is above the houses the light seen in the space\nthat is between one house and the next sinks by degrees into thicker\nmist; and yet, being less transparent, it appears whiter; and if the\nhouses are some higher than the others, since the true [colour] is\nalways more discernible through the thinner atmosphere, the houses\nwill look darker in proportion as they are higher up. Let _n o p q_\nrepresent the various density of the atmosphere thick with moisture,\n_a_ being the eye, the house _b c_ will look lightest at the bottom,\nbecause it is in a thicker atmosphere; the lines _c d f_ will appear\nequally light, for although _f_ is more distant than _c_, it is\nraised into a thinner atmosphere, if the houses _b e_ are of the\nsame height, because they cross a brightness which is varied by\nmist, but this is only because the line of the eye which starts from\nabove ends by piercing a lower and denser atmosphere at _d_ than at\n_b_. Thus the line a _f_ is lower at _f_ than at _c_; and the house\n_f_ will be seen darker at _e_ from the line _e k_ as far as _m_,\nthan the tops of the houses standing in front of it.\n\n467.\n\nOF TOWNS OR OTHER BUILDINGS SEEN IN THE EVENING OR THE MORNING\nTHROUGH THE MIST.\n\nOf buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning,\nas in mist or dense atmosphere, only those portions are seen in\nbrightness which are lighted up by the sun which is near the\nhorizon; and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun\nremain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist.\n\nWHY OBJECTS WHICH ARE HIGH UP AND AT A DISTANCE ARE DARKER THAN THE\nLOWER ONES, EVEN IF THE MIST IS UNIFORMLY DENSE.\n\nOf objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere, whether\nfrom vapour or smoke or distance, those will be most visible which\nare the highest. And among objects of equal height that will be the\ndarkest [strongest] which has for background the deepest mist. Thus\nthe eye _h_ looking at _a b c_, towers of equal height, one with\nanother, sees _c_ the top of the first tower at _r_, at two degrees\nof depth in the mist; and sees the height of the middle tower _b_\nthrough one single degree of mist. Therefore the top of the tower\n_c_ appears stronger than the top of the tower _b_, &c.\n\n468.\n\nOF THE SMOKE OF A TOWN.\n\nSmoke is seen better and more distinctly on the Eastern side than on\nthe Western when the sun is in the East; and this arises from two\ncauses; the first is that the sun, with its rays, shines through the\nparticles of the smoke and lights them up and makes them visible.\nThe second is that the roofs of the houses seen in the East at this\ntime are in shadow, because their obliquity does not allow of their\nbeing illuminated by the sun. And the same thing occurs with dust;\nand both one and the other look the lighter in proportion as they\nare denser, and they are densest towards the middle.\n\n469.\n\nOF SMOKE AND DUST.\n\nIf the sun is in the East the smoke of cities will not be visible in\nthe West,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
