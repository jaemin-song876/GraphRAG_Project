And those limbs which you allow to be seen you must make\nthicker so that the other garments may appear to be under the cloak.\nBut only give something of the true thickness of the limbs to a\nnymph [Footnote 9: _Una nifa_. Compare the beautiful drawing of a\nNymph, in black chalk from the Windsor collection, Pl. XXVI.] or an\nangel, which are represented in thin draperies, pressed and clinging\nto the limbs of the figures by the action of the wind.\n\n392.\n\nYou ought not to give to drapery a great confusion of many folds,\nbut rather only introduce them where they are held by the hands or\nthe arms; the rest you may let fall simply where it is its nature to\nflow; and do not let the nude forms be broken by too many details\nand interrupted folds. How draperies should be drawn from nature:\nthat is to say if youwant to represent woollen cloth draw the folds\nfrom that; and if it is to be silk, or fine cloth or coarse, or of\nlinen or of crape, vary the folds in each and do not represent\ndresses, as many do, from models covered with paper or thin leather\nwhich will deceive you greatly.\n\n[Footnote: The little pen and ink drawing from Windsor (W. 102),\ngiven on Pl.

In reading these\nchapters the conviction is irresistible that such a_ Botany for\npainters _is or ought to be of similar importance in the practice of\npainting as the principles of the Proportions and Movements of the\nhuman figure_ i. e. Anatomy for painters.\n\n_There can be no doubt that Leonardo, in laying down these rules,\ndid not intend to write on Botany in the proper scientific\nsense--his own researches on that subject have no place here; it\nneed only be observed that they are easily distinguished by their\ncharacter and contents from those which are here collected and\narranged under the title 'Botany for painters'. In some cases where\nthis division might appear doubtful,--as for instance in No._\n402--_the Painter is directly addressed and enjoined to take the\nrule to heart as of special importance in his art._\n\n_The original materials are principally derived from MS._ G, _in\nwhich we often find this subject treated on several pages in\nsuccession without any of that intermixture of other matters, which\nis so frequent in Leonardo's writings. This MS., too, is one of the\nlatest; when it was written, the great painter was already more than\nsixty years of age, so we can scarcely doubt that he regarded all he\nwrote as his final views on the subject. And the same remark applies\nto the chapters from MSS._ E _and_ M _which were also written\nbetween_ 1513--15.\n\n_For the sake of clearness, however, it has been desirable to\nsacrifice--with few exceptions--the original order of the passages\nas written, though it was with much reluctance and only after long\nhesitation that I resigned myself to this necessity. Nor do I mean\nto impugn the logical connection of the author's ideas in his MS.;\nbut it will be easily understood that the sequence of disconnected\nnotes, as they occurred to Leonardo and were written down from time\nto time, might be hardly satisfactory as a systematic arrangement of\nhis principles. The reader will find in the Appendix an exact\naccount of the order of the chapters in the original MS. and from\nthe data there given can restore them at will. As the materials are\nhere arranged, the structure of the tree as regards the growth of\nthe branches comes first_ (394-411) _and then the insertion of the\nleaves on the stems_ (412-419). _Then follow the laws of Light and\nShade as applied, first, to the leaves (420-434), and, secondly, to\nthe whole tree and to groups of trees_ (435-457). _After the remarks\non the Light and Shade in landscapes generally_ (458-464), _we find\nspecial observations on that of views of towns and buildings_\n(465-469). _To the theory of Landscape Painting belong also the\npassages on the effect of Wind on Trees_ (470-473) _and on the Light\nand Shade of Clouds_ (474-477), _since we find in these certain\ncomparisons with the effect of Light and Shade on Trees_ (e. g.: _in\nNo._\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
