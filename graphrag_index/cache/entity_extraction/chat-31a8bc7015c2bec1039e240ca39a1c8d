And this I did also, because that Giovanni, the German\nwho makes the mirrors, was there always in the workshop, and wanted\nto see and to know all that was being done there and made it known\noutside ... strongly criticising it; and because he dined with those\nof the Pope's guard, and then they went out with guns killing birds\namong the ruins; and this went on from after dinner till the\nevening; and when I sent Lorenzo to urge him to work he said that he\nwould not have so many masters over him, and that his work was for\nyour Excellency's Wardrobe; and thus two months passed and so it\nwent on; and one day finding Gian Niccolo of the Wardrobe and asking\nwhether the German had finished the work for your Magnificence, he\ntold me this was not true, but only that he had given him two guns\nto clean. Afterwards, when I had urged him farther, be left the\nworkshop and began to work in his room, and lost much time in making\nanother pair of pincers and files and other tools with screws; and\nthere he worked at mills for twisting silk which he hid when any one\nof my people went in, and with a thousand oaths and mutterings, so\nthat none of them would go there any more.\n\nI was so greatly rejoiced, most Illustrious Lord, by the desired\nrestoration of your health, that my own illness almost left me.

The other is that he said that his\niron-workers' rooms suited him for working at his mirrors, and of\nthis he gave proof; for besides making him my enemy, he made him\nsell all he had and leave his workshop to him, where he works with a\nnumber of workmen making numerous mirrors to send to the fairs.\n\n1352.\n\nI was so greatly rejoiced, most Illustrious Lord, by the wished for\nrecovery of your health, that my own ills have almost left me; and I\nsay God be praised for it.
