But as\nwe do not see this effect the opinion must be false.\n\nOthers say that the surface of the moon is smooth and polished and\nthat, like a mirror, it reflects in itself the image of our earth.\nThis view is also false, inasmuch as the land, where it is not\ncovered with water, presents various aspects and forms. Hence when\nthe moon is in the East it would reflect different spots from those\nit would show when it is above us or in the West; now the spots on\nthe moon, as they are seen at full moon, never vary in the course of\nits motion over our hemisphere. A second reason is that an object\nreflected in a convex body takes up but a small portion of that\nbody, as is proved in perspective [Footnote 18: _come e provato_.\nThis alludes to the accompanying diagram.]. The third reason is that\nwhen the moon is full, it only faces half the hemisphere of the\nilluminated earth, on which only the ocean and other waters reflect\nbright light, while the land makes spots on that brightness; thus\nhalf of our earth would be seen girt round with the brightness of\nthe sea lighted up by the sun, and in the moon this reflection would\nbe the smallest part of that moon. Fourthly, a radiant body cannot\nbe reflected from another equally radiant; therefore the sea, since\nit borrows its brightness from the sun,--as the moon does--, could\nnot cause the earth to be reflected in it, nor indeed could the body\nof the sun be seen reflected in it, nor indeed any star opposite to\nit.\n\n906.\n\nIf you keep the details of the spots of the moon under observation\nyou will often find great variation in them, and this I myself have\nproved by drawing them. And this is caused by the clouds that rise\nfrom the waters in the moon, which come between the sun and those\nwaters, and by their shadow deprive these waters of the sun's rays.\nThus those waters remain dark, not being able to reflect the solar\nbody.\n\n907.\n\nHow the spots on the moon must have varied from what they formerly\nwere, by reason of the course of its waters.\n\nOn the moon's halo.\n\n908.\n\nOF HALOS ROUND THE MOON.\n\nI have found, that the circles which at night seem to surround the\nmoon, of various sizes, and degrees of density are caused by various\ngradations in the densities of the vapours which exist at different\naltitudes between the moon and our eyes. And of these halos the\nlargest and least red is caused by the lowest of these vapours; the\nsecond, smaller one, is higher up, and looks redder because it is\nseen through two vapours. And so on, as they are higher they will\nappear smaller and redder, because, between the eye and them, there\nis thicker vapour. Whence it is proved that where they are seen to\nbe reddest, the vapours are most dense.\n\nOn instruments for observing the moon (909. 910).\n\n909.\n\nIf you want to prove why the moon appears larger than it is, when it\nreaches the horizon; take a lens which is highly convex on one\nsurface and concave on the opposite, and place the concave side next\nthe eye, and look at the object beyond the convex surface; by this\nmeans you will have produced an exact imitation of the atmosphere\nincluded beneath the sphere of fire and outside that of water; for\nthis atmosphere is concave on the side next the earth, and convex\ntowards the fire.\n\n910.\n\nConstruct glasses to see the moon magnified.\n\n[Footnote: See the Introduction, p. 136, Fracastoro says in his work\nHomocentres: \"_Per dua specilla ocularla si quis perspiciat, alteri\naltero superposito, majora multo et propinquiora videbit\nomnia.--Quin imo quaedam specilla ocularia fiunt tantae densitatis,\nut si per ea quis aut lunam, aut aliud siderum spectet, adeo\npropinqua illa iudicet, ut ne turres ipsas excedant_\" (sect.
