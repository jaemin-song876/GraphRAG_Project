The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the\ngreater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid\nis constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,\nas has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is\nsmaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second\nperspective [= pyramid] results from the first.\n\n90.\n\nSIMPLE PERSPECTIVE.\n\nSimple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical\nplane which is equally distant from the eye in every part. Complex\nperspective is that which is constructed on a ground-plan in which\nnone of the parts are equally distant from the eye.\n\n91.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo surface can be seen exactly as it is, if the eye that sees it is\nnot equally remote from all its edges.\n\n92.\n\nWHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE\nINDISTINCT.\n\nWhen an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its\nedges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens\nwith objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct\nshadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;\nin all cases of linear perspective, the eye acts in the same way as\nthe light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of\nvision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true\ndiscernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that\nare close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which\nsurround this chief central one and since these which are farthest\nfrom the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with\naccuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not\nat a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able\nto discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the\nlines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of\nthe eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot\ntake it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the\ncentral line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.\nHence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have\nconfused outlines.\n\nThe relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the\neye (93-98).\n\n93.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nSmall objects close at hand and large ones at a distance, being seen\nwithin equal angles, will appear of the same size.\n\n94.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThere is no object so large but that at a great distance from the\neye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.\n\n95.\n\nAmong objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest. [Footnote: This axiom, sufficiently clear in\nitself, is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram,\nconstructed like that here reproduced under No. 108.\n\nThe same idea is repeated in C. A. I a; I a, stated as follows:\n_Infra le cose d'equal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura\nche sara pi\u00f9 distante dall' ochio_.--]\n\n96.\n\nWhy an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye, and why\nwith spectacles, or without the naked eye sees badly either close or\nfar off [as the case may be].\n\n97.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAmong objects of equal size, that which is most remote from the eye\nwill look the smallest.\n\n98.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nNo second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye\nwill not see it higher than the first, if the eye is above the\nsecond.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAnd this second object will never be so much higher than the first\nas that the eye, being below them, will not see the second as lower\nthan the first.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one,\nthat is nearer, the second, larger square will appear to be\nsurrounded by the smaller one.\n\nPERSPECTIVE--PROPOSITION.\n\nObjects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in\nfront, though smaller, will conceal or surround them.\n\nDEFINITION.\n\nThis proposition can be proved by experiment. For if you look\nthrough a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be\nseen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and\nenclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole. And if you stop it\nup, this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object.\n\nThe apparent size of objects defined by calculation (99-105)\n\n99.\n\nOF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.\n\nLinear Perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight, in\nproving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the\nfirst, and how much the third is smaller than the second; and so on\nby degrees to the end of things visible. I find by experience that\nif a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from\nthe eye, although they are of the same size, the second will seem\nhalf the size of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
