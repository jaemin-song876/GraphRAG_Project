Nothing whatever was known of this previously.], where when\none sluice was opened the water which passed through it dug out the\nbottom. Therefore when the rivers are flooded, the sluices of the\nmills ought to be opened in order that the whole course of the river\nmay pass through falls to each mill; there should be many in order\nto give a greater impetus, and so all the river will be scoured. And\nbelow the site of each of the two mills there may be one of the said\nsluice falls; one of them may be placed below each mill.\n\n1078.\n\nA trabocco is four braccia, and one mile is three thousand of the\nsaid braccia. Each braccio is divided into 12 inches; and the water\nin the canals has a fall in every hundred trabocchi of two of these\ninches; therefore 14 inches of fall are necessary in two thousand\neight hundred braccia of flow in these canals; it follows that 15\ninches of fall give the required momentum to the currents of the\nwaters in the said canals, that is one braccio and a half in the\nmile. And from this it may be concluded that the water taken from\nthe river of Ville-franche and lent to the river of Romorantin\nwill..... Where one river by reason of its low level cannot flow\ninto the other, it will be necessary to dam it up, so that it may\nacquire a fall into the other, which was previously the higher.\n\nThe eve of Saint Antony I returned from Romorantin to Amboise, and\nthe King went away two days before from Romorantin.\n\n>From Romorantin as far as the bridge at Saudre it is called the\nSaudre, and from that bridge as far as Tours it is called the Cher.\n\nI would test the level of that channel which is to lead from the\nLoire to Romorantin, with a channel one braccio wide and one braccio\ndeep.\n\n[Footnote: Lines 6-18 are partly reproduced in the facsimile on p.\n254, and the whole of lines 19-25.\n\nThe following names are written along the rivers on the larger\nsketch, _era f_ (the Loire) _scier f_ (the Cher) three times. _Pote\nSodro_ (bridge of the Soudre). _Villa francha_ (Villefranche)\n_banco_ (sandbank) _Sodro_ (Soudre).
