And he who\nhas come nearest with his measure to the length of the pattern is\nthe best man, and the winner, and shall receive the prize you have\nsettled beforehand. Again you should take forshortened measures:\nthat is take a spear, or any other cane or reed, and fix on a point\nat a certain distance; and let each one estimate how many times he\njudges that its length will go into that distance. Again, who will\ndraw best a line one braccio long, which shall be tested by a\nthread. And such games give occasion to good practice for the eye,\nwhich is of the first importance in painting.\n\n508.\n\nA WAY OF DEVELOPING AND AROUSING THE MIND TO VARIOUS INVENTIONS.\n\nI cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for\nstudy which, although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous,\nis nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various\ninventions. And this is, when you look at a wall spotted with\nstains, or with a mixture of stones, if you have to devise some\nscene, you may discover a resemblance to various landscapes,\nbeautified with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide\nvalleys and hills in varied arrangement; or again you may see\nbattles and figures in action; or strange faces and costumes, and an\nendless variety of objects, which you could reduce to complete and\nwell drawn forms. And these appear on such walls confusedly, like\nthe sound of bells in whose jangle you may find any name or word you\nchoose to imagine.\n\nII.\n\nTHE ARTIST'S STUDIO.--INSTRUMENTS AND HELPS FOR THE APPLICATION OF\nPERSPECTIVE.--ON JUDGING OF A PICTURE.\n\nOn the size of the studio.\n\n509.\n\nSmall rooms or dwellings discipline the mind, large ones weaken it.\n\nOn the construction of windows (510-512).\n\n510.\n\nThe larger the wall the less the light will be.\n\n511.\n\nThe different kinds of light afforded in cellars by various forms of\nwindows. The least useful and the coldest is the window at _a_. The\nmost useful, the lightest and warmest and most open to the sky is\nthe window at _b_. The window at _c_ is of medium utility.\n\n[Footnote: From a reference to the notes on the right light for\npainting it becomes evident that the observations made on\ncellar-windows have a direct bearing on the construction of the\nstudio-window. In the diagram _b_ as well as in that under No. 510\nthe window-opening is reduced to a minimum, but only, it would seem,\nin order to emphasize the advantage of walls constructed on the plan\nthere shown.]\n\n512.\n\nOF THE PAINTER'S WINDOW AND ITS ADVANTAGE.\n\nThe painter who works from nature should have a window, which he can\nraise and lower. The reason is that sometimes you will want to\nfinish a thing you are drawing, close to the light.\n\nLet _a b c d_ be the chest on which the work may be raised or\nlowered, so that the work moves up and down and not the painter. And\nevery evening you can let down the work and shut it up above so that\nin the evening it may be in the fashion of a chest which, when shut\nup, may serve the purpose of a bench.\n\n[Footnote: See Pl. XXXI, No. 2. In this plate the lines have\nunfortunately lost their sharpness, for the accidental loss of the\nnegative has necessitated a reproduction from a positive. But having\nformerly published this sketch by another process, in VON LUTZOW'S\n_Zeitschrift fur bildende Kunst_ (Vol. XVII, pg. 13) I have\nreproduced it here in the text. The sharpness of the outline in the\noriginal sketch is here preserved but it gives it from the reversed\nside.]\n\nOn the best light for painting (513-520).\n\n513.\n\nWhich light is best for drawing from nature; whether high or low, or\nlarge or small, or strong and broad, or strong and small, or broad\nand weak or small and weak?\n\n[Footnote: The question here put is unanswered in the original MS.]\n\n514.\n\nOF THE QUALITY OF THE LIGHT.\n\nA broad light high up and not too strong will render the details of\nobjects very agreeable.\n\n515.\n\nTHAT THE LIGHT FOR DRAWING FROM NATURE SHOULD BE HIGH UP.\n\nThe light for drawing from nature should come from the North in\norder that it may not vary. And if you have it from the South, keep\nthe window screened with cloth, so that with the sun shining the\nwhole day the light may not vary. The height of the light should be\nso arranged as that every object shall cast a shadow on the ground\nof the same length as itself.\n\n516.\n\nTHE KIND OF LIGHT REQUISITE FOR PAINTING LIGHT AND SHADE.\n\nAn object will display the greatest difference of light and shade\nwhen it is seen in the strongest light, as by sunlight, or, at\nnight, by the light of a fire. But this should not be much used in\npainting because the works remain crude and ungraceful.\n\nAn object seen in a moderate\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
