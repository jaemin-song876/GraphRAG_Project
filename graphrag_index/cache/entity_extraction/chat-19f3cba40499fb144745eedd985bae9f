And on this I will\nfound my second Book. From these primary shadows there result\ncertain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and\nthese vary in character according to that of the primary shadows\nwhence they are derived. I shall therefore call these shadows\nDerived shadows because they are produced by other shadows; and the\nthird Book will treat of these. Again these derived shadows, where\nthey are intercepted by various objects, produce effects as various\nas the places where they are cast and of this I will treat in the\nfourth Book. And since all round the derived shadows, where the\nderived shadows are intercepted, there is always a space where the\nlight falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its\ncause, it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies\nit somewhat in its nature; and on this I will compose my fifth Book.\nBesides this, in the sixth Book I will investigate the many and\nvarious diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which\nwill modify the original [shadow] by [imparting] some of the various\ncolours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are\nderived. Again, the seventh Book will treat of the various distances\nthat may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and\nthat where they originate, and the various shades of colour which\nthey will acquire in falling on opaque bodies.\n\nDifferent principles and plans of treatment (112--116).\n\n112.\n\nFirst I will treat of light falling through windows which I will\ncall Restricted [Light] and then I will treat of light in the open\ncountry, to which I will give the name of diffused Light. Then I\nwill treat of the light of luminous bodies.\n\n113.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nThe conditions of shadow and light [as seen] by the eye are 3. Of\nthese the first is when the eye and the light are on the same side\nof the object seen; the 2nd is when the eye is in front of the\nobject and the light is behind it. The 3rd is when the eye is in\nfront of the object and the light is on one side, in such a way as\nthat a line drawn from the object to the eye and one from the object\nto the light should form a right angle where they meet.\n\n114.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nThis is another section: that is, of the nature of a reflection\n(from) an object placed between the eye and the light under various\naspects.\n\n115.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nAs regards all visible objects 3 things must be considered. These\nare the position of the eye which sees: that of the object seen\n[with regard] to the light, and the position of the light which\nilluminates the object, _b_ is the eye, _a_ the object seen, _c_ the\nlight, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the illuminating body, _c_ is the\nilluminated object.\n\n116.\n\nLet _a_ be the light, _b_ the eye, _c_ the object seen by the eye\nand in the light. These show, first, the eye between the light and\nthe body; the 2nd, the light between the eye and the body; the 3rd\nthe body between the eye and the light, _a_ is the eye, _b_ the\nilluminated object, _c_ the light.\n\n117.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nOF THE THREE KINDS OF LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATE OPAQUE BODIES.\n\nThe first kind of Light which may illuminate opaque bodies is called\nDirect light--as that of the sun or any other light from a window or\nflame. The second is Diffused [universal] light, such as we see in\ncloudy weather or in mist and the like. The 3rd is Subdued light,\nthat is when the sun is entirely below the horizon, either in the\nevening or morning.\n\n118.\n\nOF LIGHT.\n\nThe lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These\nare: diffused light as that of the atmosphere, within our horizon.\nAnd Direct, as that of the sun, or of a window or door or other\nopening. The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is\nthat which passes through [semi] transparent bodies, as linen or\npaper or the like, but not transparent like glass, or crystal, or\nother diaphanous bodies, which produce the same effect as though\nnothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that\nfalls upon it; and this we will discuss fully in our discourse.\n\nDefinition of the nature of shadows (119--122).\n\n119.\n\nWHAT LIGHT AND SHADOW ARE.\n\nShadow is the absence of light, merely the obstruction of the\nluminous rays by an opaque body. Shadow is of the nature of\ndarkness. Light [on an object] is of the nature of a luminous body;\none conceals and the other reveals. They are always associated and\ninseparable from all objects. But shadow is a more powerful agent\nthan light, for it can impede and entirely deprive bodies of their\nlight, while light can never entirely expel shadow from a body, that\nis from an opaque body.\n\n120.\n\nShadow is the diminution of light by the intervention of an opaque\nbody. Shadow is the counterpart of the luminous rays which are cut\noff by an opaque body.\n\nThis is proved because the shadow cast is the same in shape and size\nas\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
