We\nmust suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.\nand not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the\nBrit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.]\n\nSuggestions for the arrangement of MSS treating of particular\nsubjects.(5-8).\n\n5.\n\nOf digging a canal. Put this in the Book of useful inventions and in\nproving them bring forward the propositions already proved. And this\nis the proper order; since if you wished to show the usefulness of\nany plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove\nits utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty Books and\nalso the order of the diagrams; that is to say you would have to mix\nup practice with theory, which would produce a confused and\nincoherent work.\n\n6.\n\nI am not to blame for putting forward, in the course of my work on\nscience, any general rule derived from a previous conclusion.\n\n7.\n\nThe Book of the science of Mechanics must precede the Book of useful\ninventions.--Have your books on anatomy bound! [Footnote: 4. The\nnumerous notes on anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the\nRoyal collection at Windsor can best be classified in four Books,\ncorresponding to the different character and size of the paper. When\nLeonardo speaks of '_li tua libri di notomia_', he probably means\nthe MSS. which still exist; if this hypothesis is correct the\npresent condition of these leaves might seem to prove that he only\ncarried out his purpose with one of the Books on anatomy. A borrowed\nbook on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.]\n\n8.\n\nThe order of your book must proceed on this plan: first simple\nbeams, then (those) supported from below, then suspended in part,\nthen wholly [suspended]. Then beams as supporting other weights\n[Footnote: 4. Leonardo's notes on Mechanics are extraordinarily\nnumerous; but, for the reasons assigned in my introduction, they\nhave not been included in the present work.].\n\nGeneral introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).\n\n9.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nSeeing that I can find no subject specially useful or\npleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their\nown every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being\npoor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing\nhimself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,\nand not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,\nwill load my humble pack with this despised and rejected\nmerchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to\ndistribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,\ntaking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. [Footnote: It\nneed hardly be pointed out that there is in this 'Proemio' a covert\nirony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his\nrivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against\nNeo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its\nfutility is now no longer questioned.]\n\n10.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI know that many will call this useless work [Footnote: 3. questa\nessere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di\npittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.]; and they\nwill be those of whom Demetrius [Footnote: 4. Demetrio. \"With regard\nto the passage attributed to Demetrius\", Dr. H. M\u00dcLLER STR\u00dcBING\nwrites, \"I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not\nDemetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius\nPoliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?\nIt may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the\nspirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any\ncorresponding passage either in the 'Fragments' (C. MULLER, _Orat.\nAtt._, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (_Rhein.\nMus._, vol. 29, p. 108).\"\n\nThe same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,\napparently as a note for this '_Proemio_' thus affording some data\nas to the time where these introductions were written.] declared\nthat he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth\nin words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who\ndesire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that\nof wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.\nFor so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more\nnoble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And\noften, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I\nwonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me\nif it is something good to eat.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, the Proemio d\u00ec prospettiva cio\u00e8\ndell'uffitio dell'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
