These intersect and cross\neach other with independent convergence without interfering with\neach other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are\nof equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And\nby means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and\non all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of\nthe object that produces it.\n\nProof by experiment (65-66).\n\n65.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in\nit; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,\nwhence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as\nto face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the\nsecond and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the\nsecond takes to it the image of itself with all the images\nrepresented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,\nand so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner\nas that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the\nlast and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly\nproved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the\nobject itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object\nmay receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in\nfront of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own\nimage to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them\ninto itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in\nby the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing\ncommits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the\ninvisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the\nimage of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must\nbe disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several\nmirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.\nWhen one has reached the other it is returned to the object that\nproduced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to\nthe object and then comes back once more, and this happens\nendlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a\ndistance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an\ninfinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If\nat night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts\nof that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they\nwill receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,\nthat is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the\ntransmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater\ndegree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and\neach by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which\ncauses it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the\natmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same\ntime, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are\nin it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is\neverywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in\nevery smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all\nin each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.\n\n66.\n\nThe images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which\nreceives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c\ne_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by\nthe small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to\nthese holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the\nplane as the number of the said holes.\n\n67.\n\nGeneral conclusions.\n\nAll objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and\nmingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The\nimage of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of\nthe atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of\nthe atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the\natmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies\npresented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images\nof the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the\nsurface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that\nthe image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in\neach part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.\nAs is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.\n\n68.\n\nThat the contrary is impossible.\n\nIt is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual\nrays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front\nportion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would\nhave to go forth to the object and this it could not do without\ntime. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a\nmonth's time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach\nthe sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually\nremain in a continuous line\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
