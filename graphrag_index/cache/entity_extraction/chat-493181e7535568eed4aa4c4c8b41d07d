XCII No. 1); but it more generally\nsuggests the curve of Sta Maria del Fiore (Pl. LXXXVIII No. 5; Pl.\nXC No. 2; Pl. LXXXIX, M; Pl XC No. 4, Pl. XCVI No. 2). In other\ncases (Pl. LXXX No. 4; Pl. LXXXIX; Pl. XC No. 2) it shows the sides\nof the octagon crowned by semicircular pediments, as in\nBrunellesco's lantern of the Cathedral and in the model for the\nCathedral of Pavia.\n\nFinally, in some sketches the cupola is either semicircular, or as\nin Pl. LXXXVII No. 2, shows the beautiful line, adopted sixty years\nlater by Michael Angelo for the existing dome of St. Peter's.\n\nIt is worth noticing that for all these domes Leonardo is not\nsatisfied to decorate the exterior merely with ascending ribs or\nmouldings, but employs also a system of horizontal parallels to\ncomplete the architectural system. Not the least interesting are the\ndesigns for the tiburio (cupola) of the Milan Cathedral. They show\nsome of the forms, just mentioned, adapted to the peculiar gothic\nstyle of that monument.\n\nThe few examples of interiors of churches recall the style employed\nin Lombardy by Bramante, for instance in S. Maria di Canepanuova at\nPavia, or by Dolcebuono in the Monastero Maggiore at Milan (see Pl.\nCI No. 1 [C. A. 181b; 546b]; Pl. LXXXIV No. 10).\n\nThe few indications concerning palaces seem to prove that Leonardo\nfollowed Alberti's example of decorating the walls with pilasters\nand a flat rustica, either in stone or by graffitti (Pl. CII No. 1\nand Pl. LXXXV No. 14).\n\nBy pointing out the analogies between Leonardo's architecture and\nthat of other masters we in no way pretend to depreciate his\nindividual and original inventive power. These are at all events\nbeyond dispute. The project for the Mausoleum (Pl. XCVIII) would\nalone suffice to rank him among the greatest architects who ever\nlived. The peculiar shape of the tower (Pl. LXXX), of the churches\nfor preaching (Pl. XCVII No. 1 and pages 56 and 57, Fig. 1-4), his\ncurious plan for a city with high and low level streets (Pl. LXXVII\nand LXXVIII No. 2 and No. 3), his Loggia with fountains (Pl. LXXXII\nNo. 4) reveal an originality, a power and facility of invention for\nalmost any given problem, which are quite wonderful.\n\n_In addition to all these qualities he propably stood alone in his\nday in one department of architectural study,--his investigations,\nnamely, as to the resistance of vaults, foundations, walls and\narches._\n\n_As an application of these studies the plan of a semicircular vault\n(Pl. CIII No. 2) may be mentioned here, disposed so as to produce no\nthrust on the columns on which it rests:_ volta i botte e non\nispignie ifori le colone. _Above the geometrical patterns on the\nsame sheet, close to a circle inscribed in a square is the note:_ la\nragio d'una volta cioe il terzo del diamitro della sua ... del\ntedesco in domo.\n\n_There are few data by which to judge of Leonardo's style in the\ntreatment of detail. On Pl. LXXXV No. 10 and Pl. CIII No. 3, we find\nsome details of pillars; on Pl. CI No. 3 slender pillars designed\nfor a fountain and on Pl. CIII No. 1 MS. B, is a pen and ink drawing\nof a vase which also seems intended for a fountain. Three handles\nseem to have been intended to connect the upper parts with the base.\nThere can be no doubt that Leonardo, like Bramante, but unlike\nMichael Angelo, brought infinite delicacy of motive and execution to\nbear on the details of his work._\n\n_XIV._\n\n_Anatomy, Zoology and Physiology._\n\n_Leonardo's eminent place in the history of medicine, as a pioneer\nin the sciences of Anatomy and Physiology, will never be appreciated\ntill it is possible to publish the mass of manuscripts in which he\nlargely treated of these two branches of learning. In the present\nwork I must necessarily limit myself to giving the reader a general\nview of these labours, by publishing his introductory notes to the\nvarious books on anatomical subjects. I have added some extracts,\nand such observations as are scattered incidentally through these\ntreatises, as serving to throw a light on Leonardo's scientific\nattitude, besides having an interest for a wider circle than that of\nspecialists only._\n\n_VASARI expressly mentions Leonardo's anatomical studies, having had\noccasion to examine the manuscript books which refer to them.\nAccording to him Leonardo studied Anatomy in the companionship of\nMarc Antonio della Torre_ \"aiutato e scambievolmente\naiutando.\"_--This learned Anatomist taught the science in the\nuniversities first of Padua and then of Pavia, and at Pavia he and\nLeonardo may have worked and studied together.
