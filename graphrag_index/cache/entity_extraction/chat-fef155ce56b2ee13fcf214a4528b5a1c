As I am\nnow, on the termination of a work of several years' duration, in a\nposition to review the general tenour of Leonardos writings, I may\nperhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the\nvalue of their contents. I have already shown that it is due to\nnothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances,\nthat we should not, long since, have known Leonardo, not merely as a\nPainter, but as an Author, a Philosopher, and a Naturalist. There\ncan be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and\ndiscoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of\nmodern science, than with the views of his contemporaries. For this\nreason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be\nappreciated in our own time than they could have been during the\npreceding centuries. He has been unjustly accused of having\nsquandered his powers, by beginning a variety of studies and then,\nhaving hardly begun, throwing them aside. The truth is that the\nlabours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation\nof some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt has borne witness that \"he was the first to\nstart on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our\nsenses converge in the idea of the Unity of Nature\" Nay, yet more\nmay be said. The very words which are inscribed on the monument of\nAlexander von Humboldt himself, at Berlin, are perhaps the most\nappropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of Leonardo's\ngenius:\n\n\"Majestati naturae par ingenium.\"\n\nLONDON, April 1883.\n\nF.
