HYPOCRISY.\n\nThis animal catches a man and straightway kills him; after he is\ndead, it weeps for him with a lamentable voice and many tears. Then,\nhaving done lamenting, it cruelly devours him. It is thus with the\nhypocrite, who, for the smallest matter, has his face bathed with\ntears, but shows the heart of a tiger and rejoices in his heart at\nthe woes of others, while wearing a pitiful face.\n\nTHE TOAD.\n\nThe toad flies from the light of the sun, and if it is held there by\nforce it puffs itself out so much as to hide its head below and\nshield itself from the rays. Thus does the foe of clear and radiant\nvirtue, who can only be constrainedly brought to face it with puffed\nup courage.\n\n1242.\n\nTHE CATERPILLAR.--FOR VIRTUE IN GENERAL.\n\nThe caterpillar, which by means of assiduous care is able to weave\nround itself a new dwelling place with marvellous artifice and fine\nworkmanship, comes out of it afterwards with painted and lovely\nwings, with which it rises towards Heaven.\n\nTHE SPIDER.\n\nThe spider brings forth out of herself the delicate and ingenious\nweb, which makes her a return by the prey it takes.\n\n[Footnote: Two notes are underneath this text.

And when they are ill,\nbeing laid down, they fling up plants towards Heaven as though they\nwould offer sacrifice. --They bury their tusks when they fall out\nfrom old age.--Of these two tusks they use one to dig up roots for\nfood; but they save the point of the other for fighting with; when\nthey are taken by hunters and when worn out by fatigue, they dig up\nthese buried tusks and ransom themselves.\n\n1246.\n\nThey are merciful, and know the dangers, and if one finds a man\nalone and lost, he kindly puts him back in the road he has missed,\nif he finds the footprints of the man before the man himself.
