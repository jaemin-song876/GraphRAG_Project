And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye\n_t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise\nor lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same\nwith the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the\neye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side\nit is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the\ndirection and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must\nuse both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye\n_f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to\nthe distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the\nside towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight\nobject, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I\nsay, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is\nnearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r\ns_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at\nthe height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this\nexample, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of\nobjects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more\nremote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the\neye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which\nyour feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into\ninfinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in\nitself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which\nconvey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always\ncoincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all\nwe can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as\nthe diminishing point\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the\nfirst five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred\nto in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to\nremark.]\n\n56.\n\nthere are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up\nto this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is\nplaced towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids\nwithout bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_\nbe the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid\nterminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is\nalways in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the\neye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves\nwith it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point\nis the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the\nintervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their\nangles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the\ntermination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:\n\"By what practical experience can you show me these points?\" I\nreply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you\n--when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows\nwhich come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,\nand you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they\ntried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.\n\n[Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its\nconnection with the preceding I may here remark that the square\nplane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by\n_e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane\nof glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]\n\n57.\n\nHow to measure the pyramid of vision.\n\nAs regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by\nthis: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your\nown image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to\nthe ears of that image which you see in the other man's eye; you\nwill understand that these lines converge in such a way that they\nwould meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in\nthe eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in\nthe air which occupies the space between the object seen and the\neye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m\nn_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and\nforwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote\n9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this\nis the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_\nand you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r\no_.
