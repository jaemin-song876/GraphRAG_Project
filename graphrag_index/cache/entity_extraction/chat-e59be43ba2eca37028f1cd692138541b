They delight in rivers and are always wandering about\nnear them, though on account of their great weight they cannot swim.\nThey devour stones, and the trunks of trees are their favourite\nfood. They have a horror of rats. Flies delight in their smell and\nsettle on their back, and the beast scrapes its skin making its\nfolds even and kills them.\n\n1248.\n\nWhen they cross rivers they send their young ones up against the\nstream of the water; thus, being set towards the fall, they break\nthe united current of the water so that the current does not carry\nthem away. The dragon flings itself under the elephant's body, and\nwith its tail it ties its legs; with its wings and with its arms it\nalso clings round its ribs and cuts its throat with its teeth, and\nthe elephant falls upon it and the dragon is burst. Thus, in its\ndeath it is revenged on its foe.\n\nTHE DRAGON.\n\nThese go in companies together, and they twine themselves after the\nmanner of roots, and with their heads raised they cross lakes, and\nswim to where they find better pasture; and if they did not thus\ncombine\n\n1249.\n\nthey would be drowned, therefore they combine.\n\nTHE SERPENT.\n\nThe serpent is a very large animal. When it sees a bird in the air\nit draws in its breath so strongly that it draws the birds into its\nmouth too. Marcus Regulus, the consul of the Roman army was\nattacked, with his army, by such an animal and almost defeated. And\nthis animal, being killed by a catapult, measured 123 feet, that is\n64 1/2 braccia and its head was high above all the trees in a wood.\n\nTHE BOA(?)\n\nThis is a very large snake which entangles itself round the legs of\nthe cow so that it cannot move and then sucks it, in such wise that\nit almost dries it up. In the time of Claudius the Emperor, there\nwas killed, on the Vatican Hill,\n\n1250.\n\none which had inside it a boy, entire, that it had swallowed.\n\nTHE MACLI.--CAUGHT WHEN ASLEEP.\n\nThis beast is born in Scandinavia. It has the shape of a great\nhorse, excepting that the great length of its neck and of its ears\nmake a difference. It feeds on grass, going backwards, for it has so\nlong an upper lip that if it went forwards it would cover up the\ngrass. Its legs are all in one piece; for this reason when it wants\nto sleep it leans against a tree, and the hunters, spying out the\nplace where it is wont to sleep, saw the tree almost through, and\nthen, when it leans against it to sleep, in its sleep it falls, and\nthus the hunters take it. And every other mode of taking it is in\nvain, because it is incredibly swift in running.\n\n1251.\n\nTHE BISON WHICH DOES INJURY IN ITS FLIGHT.\n\nThis beast is a native of Paeonia and has a neck with a mane like a\nhorse. In all its other parts it is like a bull, excepting that its\nhorns are in a way bent inwards so that it cannot butt; hence it has\nno safety but in flight, in which it flings out its excrement to a\ndistance of 400 braccia in its course, and this burns like fire\nwherever it touches.\n\nLIONS, PARDS, PANTHERS, TIGERS.\n\nThese keep their claws in the sheath, and never put them out unless\nthey are on the back of their prey or their enemy.\n\nTHE LIONESS.\n\nWhen the lioness defends her young from the hand of the hunter, in\norder not to be frightened by the spears she keeps her eyes on the\nground, to the end that she may not by her flight leave her young\nones prisoners.\n\n1252.\n\nTHE LION.\n\nThis animal, which is so terrible, fears nothing more than the noise\nof empty carts, and likewise the crowing of cocks. And it is much\nterrified at the sight of one, and looks at its comb with a\nfrightened aspect, and is strangely alarmed when its face is\ncovered.\n\nTHE PANTHER IN AFRICA.\n\nThis has the form of the lioness but it is taller on its legs and\nslimmer and long bodied; and it is all white and marked with black\nspots after the manner of rosettes; and all animals delight to look\nupon these rosettes, and they would always be standing round it if\nit were not for the terror of its face;\n\n1253.\n\ntherefore knowing this, it hides its face, and the surrounding\nanimals grow bold and come close, the better to enjoy the sight of\nso much beauty; when suddenly it seizes the nearest and at once\ndevours it.\n\nCAMELS.\n\nThe Bactrian have two humps; the Arabian one only. They are swift in\nbattle and most useful to carry burdens. This animal is extremely\nobservant of rule and measure, for it will not move if it has a\ngreater weight than it is used to, and if it is taken too far it\ndoes the same, and suddenly stops and so the merchants are obliged\nto lodge there.\n\n1254.\n\nTHE TIGER.\n\nThis beast is a native of Hyrcania, and it is something like the\npanther from the various spots on its skin.
