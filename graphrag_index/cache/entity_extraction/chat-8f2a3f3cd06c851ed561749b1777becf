And\ntherefore, my Lord, I entreat you, as urgently as I know how and am\nable, that your Highness will write a letter to the said Ser\nRaphaello in that admirable and pressing manner which your Highness\ncan use, recommending to him Leonardo Vincio, your most humble\nservant as I am, and shall always be; requesting him and pressing\nhim not only to do me justice but to do so with despatch; and I have\nnot the least doubt, from many things that I hear, that Ser\nRaphaello, being most affectionately devoted to your Highness, the\nmatter will issue _ad votum_. And this I shall attribute to your\nmost Reverend Highness' letter, to whom I once more humbly commend\nmyself. _Et bene valeat_.\n\nFlorence XVIIIa 7bris 1507. E. V. R.

I\nnow send Salai to explain to your Lordship that I am almost at an\nend of the litigation I had with my brother; that I hope to find\nmyself with you this Easter, and to carry with me two pictures of\ntwo Madonnas of different sizes. These were done for our most\nChristian King, or for whomsoever your Lordship may please. I should\nbe very glad to know on my return thence where I may have to reside,\nfor I would not give any more trouble to your Lordship. Also, as I\nhave worked for the most Christian King, whether my salary is to\ncontinue or not. I wrote to the President as to that water which the\nking granted me, and which I was not put in possession of because at\nthat time there was a dearth in the canal by reason of the great\ndroughts and because [Footnote:Compare Nos. 1009 and 1010. Leonardo\nhas noted the payment of the pension from the king in 1505.] its\noutlets were not regulated; but he certainly promised me that when\nthis was done I should be put in possession. Thus I pray your\nLordship that you will take so much trouble, now that these outlets\nare regulated, as to remind the President of my matter; that is, to\ngive me possession of this water, because on my return I hope to\nmake there instruments and other things which will greatly please\nour most Christian King. Nothing else occurs to me. I am always\nyours to command. [Footnote:1349. Charles d'Amboise, Marechal de\nChaumont, was Governor of Milan under Louis XII. Leonardo was in\npersonal communication with him so early as in 1503. He was absent\nfrom Milan in the autumn of 1506 and from October l5l0--when he\nbesieged Pope Julius II. in Bologna--till his death, which took\nplace at Correggio, February 11, 1511. Francesco Vinci, Leonardo's\nuncle, died--as Amoretti tells us--in the winter of l5l0-11 (or\naccording to Uzielli in 1506?), and Leonardo remained in Florence\nfor business connected with his estate. The letter written with\nreference to this affair, No. 1348, is undoubtedly earlier than the\nletters Nos. 1349 and 1350. Amoretti tells us, _Memorie Storiche_,\nch.
