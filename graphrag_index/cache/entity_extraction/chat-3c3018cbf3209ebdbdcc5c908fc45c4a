All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,\nthat all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of\nlines.\n\nBy a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the\nedges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet\nin a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will\nshow to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all\nobjects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;\ntherefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being\nindivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than\nthis point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines\nwhich come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if\nany man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in\nthis point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the\nmiddle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could\nnever diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or\nof oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger\nthan the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be\nseen in the diagram below. Let _a_. be the seat of sight, _b e_ the\nlines which reach the eye. Let _e d_ be the grains of millet within\nthese lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by\ndistance, and that the body _m n_ could not be entirely covered by\nit. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself\none single indivisible point _a_, to which all the points converge\nof the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.\nLet _a_. _b_. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point above\nmentioned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small\nan opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object\ncannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is\ndiminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.\n\n53.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nPerspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in\nobjects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for\ndetermining with exactitude how near one object is to another which\nis equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level\nof the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the\nvertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let\n_n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c\nd_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_\nand _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,\nthen _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off\nfrom _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will\nappear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter\nwho is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is\npainting.\n\n54.\n\nTO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.\n\nIf you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut\nyour eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.\nThis is evidence that images enter into the eye.\n\nThe relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).\n\n55.\n\nELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the\nnearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will\nthe image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may\nintersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.\nCompare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer\nexclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of\nthis it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as\nrepresenting the section or profile of a square plane, placed\nhorizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_\nis subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain\npreliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the\ndiagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.\nLeonardo's mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has\nbeen rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown\nin the plane _a n_.\n\nThe eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye\n_f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from\nthe object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is\nwhether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the\nobject you are looking at. And remember that the eye _\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
