The experiment is the following. Let a\nman be placed on a steel yard in the middle of the shaft of a well,\nthen let him spread out his hands and feet between the walls of the\nwell, and you will see him weigh much less on the steel yard; give\nhim a weight on the shoulders, you will see by experiment, that the\ngreater the weight you give him the greater effort he will make in\nspreading his arms and legs, and in pressing against the wall and\nthe less weight will be thrown on the steel yard.\n\nIV.\n\nON FOUNDATIONS, THE NATURE OF THE GROUND AND SUPPORTS.\n\n789.\n\nThe first and most important thing is stability.\n\nAs to the foundations of the component parts of temples and other\npublic buildings, the depths of the foundations must bear the same\nproportions to each other as the weight of material which is to be\nplaced upon them.\n\nEvery part of the depth of earth in a given space is composed of\nlayers, and each layer is composed of heavier or lighter materials,\nthe lowest being the heaviest. And this can be proved, because these\nlayers have been formed by the sediment from water carried down to\nthe sea, by the current of rivers which flow into it. The heaviest\npart of this sediment was that which was first thrown down, and so\non by degrees; and this is the action of water when it becomes\nstagnant, having first brought down the mud whence it first flowed.\nAnd such layers of soil are seen in the banks of rivers, where their\nconstant flow has cut through them and divided one slope from the\nother to a great depth; where in gravelly strata the waters have run\noff, the materials have, in consequence, dried and been converted\ninto hard stone, and this happened most in what was the finest mud;\nwhence we conclude that every portion of the surface of the earth\nwas once at the centre of the earth, and _vice_versa_ &c.\n\n790.\n\nThe heaviest part of the foundations of buildings settles most, and\nleaves the lighter part above it separated from it.\n\nAnd the soil which is most pressed, if it be porous yields most.\n\nYou should always make the foundations project equally beyond the\nweight of the walls and piers, as shown at _m a b_. If you do as\nmany do, that is to say if you make a foundation of equal width from\nthe bottom up to the surface of the ground, and charge it above with\nunequal weights, as shown at _b e_ and at _e o_, at the part of the\nfoundation at _b e_, the pier of the angle will weigh most and\nthrust its foundation downwards, which the wall at _e o_ will not\ndo; since it does not cover the whole of its foundation, and\ntherefore thrusts less heavily and settles less. Hence, the pier _b\ne_ in settling cracks and parts from the wall _e o_. This may be\nseen in most buildings which are cracked round the piers.\n\n791.\n\nThe window _a_ is well placed under the window _c_, and the window\n_b_ is badly placed under the pier _d_, because this latter is\nwithout support and foundation; mind therefore never to make a break\nunder the piers between the windows.\n\n792.\n\nOF THE SUPPORTS.\n\nA pillar of which the thickness is increased will gain more than its\ndue strength, in direct proportion to what its loses in relative\nheight.\n\nEXAMPLE.\n\nIf a pillar should be nine times as high as it is broad--that is to\nsay, if it is one braccio thick, according to rule it should be nine\nbraccia high--then, if you place 100 such pillars together in a mass\nthis will be ten braccia broad and 9 high; and if the first pillar\ncould carry 10000 pounds the second being only about as high as it\nis wide, and thus lacking 8 parts of its proper length, it, that is\nto say, each pillar thus united, will bear eight times more than\nwhen disconnected; that is to say, that if at first it would carry\nten thousand pounds, it would now carry 90 thousand.\n\nV.\n\nON THE RESISTANCE OF BEAMS.\n\n793.\n\nThat angle will offer the greatest resistance which is most acute,\nand the most obtuse will be the weakest.\n\n[Footnote: The three smaller sketches accompany the text in the\noriginal, but the larger one is not directly connected with it. It\nis to be found on fol. 89a of the same Manuscript and there we read\nin a note, written underneath, _coverchio della perdicha del\ncastello_ (roof of the flagstaff of the castle),--Compare also Pl.\nXCIII, No. 1.]\n\n794.\n\nIf the beams and the weight _o_ are 100 pounds, how much weight will\nbe wanted at _ae_ to resist such a weight, that it may not fall\ndown?\n\n795.\n\nON THE LENGTH OF BEAMS.\n\nThat beam which is more than 20 times as long as its greatest\nthickness will be of brief duration and will break in half; and\nremember, that the part built into the wall should be steeped in hot\npitch and filleted with oak boards likewise so steeped. Each beam\nmust pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with\nsufficient chaining, because in consequence of earthquakes the beams\nare often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and\nfloors; whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
