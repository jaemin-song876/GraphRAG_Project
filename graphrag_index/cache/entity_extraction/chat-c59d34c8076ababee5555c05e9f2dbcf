When the water rushes out from the\nburst vein in the earth, it obeys the law of other bodies that are\nheavier than the air since it always seeks low places.\n\n[Footnote: From this passage it is quite plain that Leonardo had not\nmerely a general suspicion of the circulation of the blood but a\nvery clear conception of it.

WILLIAM\nHARVEY (born 1578 and Professor of Anatomy at Cambridge from 1615)\nis always considered to have been the discoverer of the circulation\nof the blood. He studied medicine at Padua in 1598, and in 1628\nbrought out his memorable and important work: _De motu cordis et\nsanguinis_.]\n\n850.\n\nThat the blood which returns when the heart opens again is not the\nsame as that which closes the valves of the heart.\n\nSome notes on medicine (851-855).\n\n851.\n\nMake them give you the definition and remedies for the case ... and\nyou will see that men are selected to be doctors for diseases they\ndo not know.\n\n852.\n\nA remedy for scratches taught me by the Herald to the King of\nFrance. 4 ounces of virgin wax, 4 ounces of colophony, 2 ounces of\nincense.
