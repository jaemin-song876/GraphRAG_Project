This hypothesis has\nlately been confirmed by the publication of certain documents,\npreserved at Milan, showing that Leonardo was not only employed in\npreparing plans but that he took an active part, with much credit,\nas member of a commission on public buildings; his name remains\nlinked with the history of the building of the Cathedral at Pavia\nand that of the Cathedral at Milan._\n\n_Leonardo's writings on Architecture are dispersed among a large\nnumber of MSS., and it would be scarcely possible to master their\ncontents without the opportunity of arranging, sorting and comparing\nthe whole mass of materials, so as to have some comprehensive idea\nof the whole. The sketches, when isolated and considered by\nthemselves, might appear to be of but little value; it is not till\nwe understand their general purport, from comparing them with each\nother, that we can form any just estimate of their true worth._\n\n_Leonardo seems to have had a project for writing a complete and\nseparate treatise on Architecture, such as his predecessors and\ncontemporaries had composed--Leon Battista Alberti, Filarete,\nFrancesco di Giorgio and perhaps also Bramante. But, on the other\nhand, it cannot be denied that possibly no such scheme was connected\nwith the isolated notes and researches, treating on special\nquestions, which are given in this work; that he was merely working\nat problems in which, for some reason or other he took a special\ninterest._\n\n_A great number of important buildings were constructed in Lombardy\nduring the period between 1472 and 1499, and among them there are\nseveral by unknown architects, of so high an artistic merit, that it\nis certainly not improbable that either Bramante or Leonardo da\nVinci may have been, directly or indirectly, concerned in their\nerection._\n\n_Having been engaged, for now nearly twenty years, in a thorough\nstudy of Bramante's life and labours, I have taken a particular\ninterest in detecting the distinguishing marks of his style as\ncompared with Leonardo's. In 1869 I made researches about the\narchitectural drawings of the latter in the Codex Atlanticus at\nMilan, for the purpose of finding out, if possible the original\nplans and sketches of the churches of Santa Maria delle Grazie at\nMilan, and of the Cathedral at Pavia, which buildings have been\nsupposed to be the work both of Bramante and of Leonardo. Since 1876\nI have repeatedly examined Leonardo's architectural studies in the\ncollection of his manuscripts in the Institut de France, and some of\nthese I have already given to the public in my work on_ \"Les Projets\nPrimitifs pour la Basilique de St. Pierre de Rome\", _P1. 43. In 1879\nI had the opportunity of examining the manuscript in the Palazzo\nTrivulzio at Milan, and in 1880 Dr Richter showed me in London the\nmanuscripts in the possession of Lord Ashburnham, and those in the\nBritish Museum. I have thus had opportunities of seeing most of\nLeonardo's architectural drawings in the original, but of the\nmanuscripts tliemselves I have deciphered only the notes which\naccompany the sketches. It is to Dr Richter's exertions that we owe\nthe collected texts on Architecture which are now published, and\nwhile he has undertaken to be responsible for the correct reading of\nthe original texts, he has also made it his task to extract the\nwhole of the materials from the various MSS. It has been my task to\narrange and elucidate the texts under the heads which have been\nadopted in this work. MS. B. at Paris and the Codex Atlanticus at\nMilan are the chief sources of our knowledge of Leonardo as an\narchitect, and I have recently subjected these to a thorough\nre-investigation expressly with a view to this work._\n\n_A complete reproduction of all Leonardo's architectural sketches\nhas not, indeed, been possible, but as far as the necessarily\nrestricted limits of the work have allowed, the utmost completeness\nhas been aimed at, and no efforts have been spared to include every\nthing that can contribute to a knowledge of Leonardo's style. It\nwould have been very interesting, if it had been possible, to give\nsome general account at least of Leonardo's work and studies in\nengineering, fortification, canal-making and the like, and it is\nonly on mature reflection that we have reluctantly abandoned this\nidea. Leonardo's occupations in these departments have by no means\nso close a relation to literary work, in the strict sense of the\nword as we are fairly justified in attributing to his numerous notes\non Architecture._\n\n_Leonardo's architectural studies fall naturally under two heads:_\n\n_I. Those drawings and sketches, often accompanied by short remarks\nand explanations, which may be regarded as designs for buildings or\nmonuments intended to be built. With these there are occasionally\nexplanatory texts._\n\n_II. Theoretical investigations and treatises. A special interest\nattaches to these because they discuss a variety of questions which\nare of practical importance to this day. Leonardo's theory as to the\norigin and progress of cracks in buildings is perhaps to be\nconsidered as unique in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
