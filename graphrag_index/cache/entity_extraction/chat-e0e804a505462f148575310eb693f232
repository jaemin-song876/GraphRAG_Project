Three\nother figures of the bones complete, and of the nerves which rise\nfrom the nape of the neck, and in what limbs they ramify. And three\nothers of the bones and veins, and where they ramify. Then three\nfigures with the muscles and three with the skin, and their proper\nproportions; and three of woman, to illustrate the womb and the\nmenstrual veins which go to the breasts.\n\n[Footnote: The meaning of the word _nervo_ varies in different\npassages, being sometimes used for _muscolo_ (muscle).]\n\n798.\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BOOK.\n\nThis depicting of mine of the human body will be as clear to you as\nif you had the natural man before you; and the reason is that if you\nwish thoroughly to know the parts of man, anatomically, you--or your\neye--require to see it from different aspects, considering it from\nbelow and from above and from its sides, turning it about and\nseeking the origin of each member; and in this way the natural\nanatomy is sufficient for your comprehension. But you must\nunderstand that this amount of knowledge will not continue to\nsatisfy you; seeing the very great confusion that must result from\nthe combination of tissues, with veins, arteries, nerves, sinews,\nmuscles, bones, and blood which, of itself, tinges every part the\nsame colour. And the veins, which discharge this blood, are not\ndiscerned by reason of their smallness. Moreover integrity of the\ntissues, in the process of the investigating the parts within them,\nis inevitably destroyed, and their transparent substance being\ntinged with blood does not allow you to recognise the parts covered\nby them, from the similarity of their blood-stained hue; and you\ncannot know everything of the one without confusing and destroying\nthe other. Hence, some further anatomy drawings become necessary. Of\nwhich you want three to give full knowledge of the veins and\narteries, everything else being destroyed with the greatest care.\nAnd three others to display the tissues; and three for the sinews\nand muscles and ligaments; and three for the bones and cartilages;\nand three for the anatomy of the bones, which have to be sawn to\nshow which are hollow and which are not, which have marrow and which\nare spongy, and which are thick from the outside inwards, and which\nare thin. And some are extremely thin in some parts and thick in\nothers, and in some parts hollow or filled up with bone, or full of\nmarrow, or spongy. And all these conditions are sometimes found in\none and the same bone, and in some bones none of them. And three you\nmust have for the woman, in which there is much that is mysterious\nby reason of the womb and the foetus. Therefore by my drawings every\npart will be known to you, and all by means of demonstrations from\nthree different points of view of each part; for when you have seen\na limb from the front, with any muscles, sinews, or veins which take\ntheir rise from the opposite side, the same limb will be shown to\nyou in a side view or from behind, exactly as if you had that same\nlimb in your hand and were turning it from side to side until you\nhad acquired a full comprehension of all you wished to know. In the\nsame way there will be put before you three or four demonstrations\nof each limb, from various points of view, so that you will be left\nwith a true and complete knowledge of all you wish to learn of the\nhuman figure[Footnote 35: Compare Pl. CVII. The original drawing at\nWindsor is 28 1/2 X 19 1/2 centimetres. The upper figures are\nslightly washed with Indian ink. On the back of this drawing is the\ntext No. 1140.].\n\nThus, in twelve entire figures, you will have set before you the\ncosmography of this lesser world on the same plan as, before me, was\nadopted by Ptolemy in his cosmography; and so I will afterwards\ndivide them into limbs as he divided the whole world into provinces;\nthen I will speak of the function of each part in every direction,\nputting before your eyes a description of the whole form and\nsubstance of man, as regards his movements from place to place, by\nmeans of his different parts. And thus, if it please our great\nAuthor, I may demonstrate the nature of men, and their customs in\nthe way I describe his figure.\n\nAnd remember that the anatomy of the nerves will not give the\nposition of their ramifications, nor show you which muscles they\nbranch into, by means of bodies dissected in running water or in\nlime water; though indeed their origin and starting point may be\nseen without such water as well as with it. But their ramifications,\nwhen under running water, cling and unite--just like flat or hemp\ncarded for spinning--all into a skein, in a way which makes it\nimpossible to trace in which muscles or by what ramification the\nnerves are distributed among those muscles.\n\n799.\n\nTHE ARRANGEMENT OF ANATOMY\n\nFirst draw the bones, let us say, of the arm, and put in the motor\nmuscle from the shoulder to the elbow with all its lines. Then\nproceed in the same way from the elbow to the wrist.
