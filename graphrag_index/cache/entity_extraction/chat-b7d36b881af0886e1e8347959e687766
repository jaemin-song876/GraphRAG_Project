The same thing happens with the above\nmentioned planets which, though they have no light of their own, do\nnot--as has been said--conceal any part of the sun from our eye\n[18].\n\nSECOND ARGUMENT.\n\nSome say that the stars appear most brilliant at night in proportion\nas they are higher up; and that if they had no light of their own,\nthe shadow of the earth which comes between them and the sun, would\ndarken them, since they would not face nor be faced by the solar\nbody. But those persons have not considered that the conical shadow\nof the earth cannot reach many of the stars; and even as to those it\ndoes reach, the cone is so much diminished that it covers very\nlittle of the star's mass, and all the rest is illuminated by the\nsun.\n\n913.\n\nWhy the planets appear larger in the East than they do overhead,\nwhereas the contrary should be the case, as they are 3500 miles\nnearer to us when in mid sky than when on the horizon.\n\nAll the degrees of the elements, through which the images of the\ncelestial bodies pass to reach the eye, are equal curves and the\nangles by which the central line of those images passes through\nthem, are unequal angles [Footnote 13: _inequali_, here and\nelsewhere does not mean unequal in the sense of not being equal to\neach other, but angles which are not right angles.]; and the\ndistance is greater, as is shown by the excess of _a b_ beyond _a\nd_; and the enlargement of these celestial bodies on the horizon is\nshown by the 9th of the 7th.\n\nObservations on the stars.\n\n914.\n\nTo see the real nature of the planets open the covering and note at\nthe base [Footnote 4: _basa_. This probably alludes to some\ninstrument, perhaps the Camera obscura.] one single planet, and the\nreflected movement of this base will show the nature of the said\nplanet; but arrange that the base may face only one at the time.\n\nOn history of astronomy.\n\n915.\n\nCicero says in [his book] De Divinatione that Astrology has been\npractised five hundred seventy thousand years before the Trojan war.\n\n57000.\n\n[Footnote: The statement that CICERO, _De Divin._ ascribes the\ndiscovery of astrology to a period 57000 years before the Trojan war\nI believe to be quite erroneous. According to ERNESTI, _Clavis\nCiceroniana,_ CH. G. SCHULZ (_Lexic. Cicer._) and the edition of _De\nDivin._ by GIESE the word Astrologia occurs only twice in CICERO:\n_De Divin. II_, 42. _Ad Chaldaeorum monstra veniamus, de quibus\nEudoxus, Platonis auditor, in astrologia judicio doctissimorum\nhominum facile princeps, sic opinatur (id quod scriptum reliquit):\nChaldaeis in praedictione et in notatione cujusque vitae ex natali\ndie minime esse credendum._\" He then quotes the condemnatory verdict\nof other philosophers as to the teaching of the Chaldaeans but says\nnothing as to the antiquity and origin of astronomy. CICERO further\nnotes _De oratore_ I, 16 that Aratus was \"_ignarus astrologiae_\" but\nthat is all. So far as I know the word occurs nowhere else in\nCICERO; and the word _Astronomia_ he does not seem to have used at\nall. (H. MULLER-STRUBING.)]\n\nOf time and its divisions (916-918).\n\n916.\n\nAlthough time is included in the class of Continuous Quantities,\nbeing indivisible and immaterial, it does not come entirely under\nthe head of Geometry, which represents its divisions by means of\nfigures and bodies of infinite variety, such as are seen to be\ncontinuous in their visible and material properties. But only with\nits first principles does it agree, that is with the Point and the\nLine; the point may be compared to an instant of time, and the line\nmay be likened to the length of a certain quantity of time, and just\nas a line begins and terminates in a point, so such a space of time.\nbegins and terminates in an instant. And whereas a line is\ninfinitely divisible, the divisibility of a space of time is of the\nsame nature; and as the divisions of the line may bear a certain\nproportion to each other, so may the divisions of time.\n\n[Footnote: This passage is repeated word for word on page 190b of\nthe same manuscript and this is accounted for by the text in Vol. I,\nNo. 4.
