Thus by these two movements\ncombined in a constant circulation, it travels through the veins of\nthe earth.\n\n966.\n\nWHETHER WATER RISES FROM THE SEA TO THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.\n\nThe water of the ocean cannot make its way from the bases to the\ntops of the mountains which bound it, but only so much rises as the\ndryness of the mountain attracts. And if, on the contrary, the rain,\nwhich penetrates from the summit of the mountain to the base, which\nis the boundary of the sea, descends and softens the slope opposite\nto the said mountain and constantly draws the water, like a syphon\n[Footnote 11: Cicognola, Syphon. See Vol. I, Pl. XXIV, No. 1.] which\npours through its longest side, it must be this which draws up the\nwater of the sea; thus if _s n_ were the surface of the sea, and the\nrain descends from the top of the mountain _a_ to _n_ on one side,\nand on the other sides it descends from _a_ to _m_, without a doubt\nthis would occur after the manner of distilling through felt, or as\nhappens through the tubes called syphons [Footnote 17: Cicognola,\nSyphon. See Vol. I, Pl. XXIV, No. 1.]. And at all times the water\nwhich has softened the mountain, by the great rain which runs down\nthe two opposite sides, would constantly attract the rain _a n_, on\nits longest side together with the water from the sea, if that side\nof the mountain _a m_ were longer than the other _a n_; but this\ncannot be, because no part of the earth which is not submerged by\nthe ocean can be lower than that ocean.\n\n967.\n\nOF SPRINGS OF WATER ON THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.\n\nIt is quite evident that the whole surface of the ocean--when there\nis no storm--is at an equal distance from the centre of the earth,\nand that the tops of the mountains are farther from this centre in\nproportion as they rise above the surface of that sea; therefore if\nthe body of the earth were not like that of man, it would be\nimpossible that the waters of the sea--being so much lower than the\nmountains--could by their nature rise up to the summits of these\nmountains. Hence it is to be believed that the same cause which\nkeeps the blood at the top of the head in man keeps the water at the\nsummits of the mountains.\n\n[Footnote: This conception of the rising of the blood, which has\ngiven rise to the comparison, was recognised as erroneous by\nLeonardo himself at a later period. It must be remembered that the\nMS. A, from which these passages are taken, was written about twenty\nyears earlier than the MS. Leic. (Nos. 963 and 849) and twenty-five\nyears before the MS. W. An. IV.\n\nThere is, in the original a sketch with No. 968 which is not\nreproduced. It represents a hill of the same shape as that shown at\nNo. 982. There are veins, or branched streams, on the side of the\nhill, like those on the skull Pl. CVIII, No. 4]\n\n968.\n\nIN CONFIRMATION OF WHY THE WATER GOES TO THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.\n\nI say that just as the natural heat of the blood in the veins keeps\nit in the head of man,--for when the man is dead the cold blood\nsinks to the lower parts--and when the sun is hot on the head of a\nman the blood increases and rises so much, with other humours, that\nby pressure in the veins pains in the head are often caused; in the\nsame way veins ramify through the body of the earth, and by the\nnatural heat which is distributed throughout the containing body,\nthe water is raised through the veins to the tops of mountains. And\nthis water, which passes through a closed conduit inside the body of\nthe mountain like a dead thing, cannot come forth from its low place\nunless it is warmed by the vital heat of the spring time. Again, the\nheat of the element of fire and, by day, the heat of the sun, have\npower to draw forth the moisture of the low parts of the mountains\nand to draw them up, in the same way as it draws the clouds and\ncollects their moisture from the bed of the sea.\n\n969.\n\nThat many springs of salt water are found at great distances from\nthe sea; this might happen because such springs pass through some\nmine of salt, like that in Hungary where salt is hewn out of vast\ncaverns, just as stone is hewn\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
