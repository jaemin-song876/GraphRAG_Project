But reflected lights will, on those same\nobjects, appear in as many different places on the surface as\ndifferent positions are taken by the eye.\n\nWHAT BODIES HAVE LIGHT UPON THEM WITHOUT LUSTRE?\n\nOpaque bodies which have a hard and rough surface never display any\nlustre in any portion of the side on which the light falls.\n\nWHAT BODIES WILL DISPLAY LUSTRE BUT NOT LOOK ILLUMINATED?\n\nThose bodies which are opaque and hard with a hard surface reflect\nlight [lustre] from every spot on the illuminated side which is in a\nposition to receive light at the same angle of incidence as they\noccupy with regard to the eye; but, as the surface mirrors all the\nsurrounding objects, the illuminated [body] is not recognisable in\nthese portions of the illuminated body.\n\n136.\n\nThe relations of luminous to illuminated bodies.\n\nThe middle of the light and shade on an object in light and shade is\nopposite to the middle of the primary light. All light and shadow\nexpresses itself in pyramidal lines. The middle of the shadow on any\nobject must necessarily be opposite the middle of its light, with a\ndirect line passing through the centre of the body. The middle of\nthe light will be at _a_, that of the shadow at _b_. [Again, in\nbodies shown in light and shade the middle of each must coincide\nwith the centre of the body, and a straight line will pass through\nboth and through that centre.]\n\n[Footnote: In the original MS., at the spot marked _a_ of the first\ndiagram Leonardo wrote _primitiuo_, and at the spot marked\n_c_--_primitiva_ (primary); at the spot marked _b_ he wrote\n_dirivatiuo_ and at _d deriuatiua_ (derived).]\n\nExperiments on the relation of light and shadow within a room\n(137--140).\n\n137.\n\nSHOWS HOW LIGHT FROM ANY SIDE CONVERGES TO ONE POINT.\n\nAlthough the balls _a b c_ are lighted from one window,\nnevertheless, if you follow the lines of their shadows you will see\nthey intersect at a point forming the angle _n_.\n\n[Footnote: The diagram belonging to this passage is slightly\nsketched on Pl.
