The sea does not raise the water that has issued\nfrom the straits, but it checks them and this retards the tide; then\nit makes up with furious haste for the time it has lost until the\nend of the ebb movement.\n\n959.\n\nThat the flow and ebb are not general; for on the shore at Genoa\nthere is none, at Venice two braccia, between England and Flanders\n18 braccia. That in the straits of Sicily the current is very strong\nbecause all the waters from the rivers that flow into the Adriatic\npass there.\n\n[Footnote: A few more recent data may be given here to facilitate\ncomparison. In the Adriatic the tide rises 2 and 1/2 feet, at\nTerracina 1 1/4. In the English channel between Calais and Kent it\nrises from 18 to 20 feet. In the straits of Messina it rises no more\nthan 2 1/2 feet, and that only in stormy weather, but the current is\nall the stronger. When Leonardo accounts for this by the southward\nflow of all the Italian rivers along the coasts, the explanation is\nat least based on a correct observation; namely that a steady\ncurrent flows southwards along the coast of Calabria and another\nnorthwards, along the shores of Sicily; he seems to infer, from the\ndirection of the fust, that the tide in the Adriatic is caused by\nit.]\n\n960.\n\nIn the West, near to Flanders, the sea rises and decreases every 6\nhours about 20 braccia, and 22 when the moon is in its favour; but\n20 braccia is the general rule, and this rule, as it is evident,\ncannot have the moon for its cause. This variation in the increase\nand decrease of the sea every 6 hours may arise from the damming up\nof the waters, which are poured into the Mediterranean by the\nquantity of rivers from Africa, Asia and Europe, which flow into\nthat sea, and the waters which are given to it by those rivers; it\npours them to the ocean through the straits of Gibraltar, between\nAbila and Calpe [Footnote 5: _Abila_, Lat. _Abyla_, Gr. , now\nSierra _Ximiera_ near Ceuta; _Calpe_, Lat. _Calpe_. Gr., now\nGibraltar. Leonardo here uses the ancient names of the rocks, which\nwere known as the Pillars of Hercules.]. That ocean extends to the\nisland of England and others farther North, and it becomes dammed up\nand kept high in various gulfs. These, being seas of which the\nsurface is remote from the centre of the earth, have acquired a\nweight, which as it is greater than the force of the incoming waters\nwhich cause it, gives this water an impetus in the contrary\ndirection to that in which it came and it is borne back to meet the\nwaters coming out of the straits; and this it does most against the\nstraits of Gibraltar; these, so long as this goes on, remain dammed\nup and all the water which is poured out meanwhile by the\naforementioned rivers, is pent up [in the Mediterranean]; and this\nmight be assigned as the cause of its flow and ebb, as is shown in\nthe 21st of the 4th of my theory.\n\nIII.\n\nSUBTERRANEAN WATER COURSES.\n\nTheory of the circulation of the waters (961. 962).\n\n961.\n\nVery large rivers flow under ground.\n\n962.\n\nThis is meant to represent the earth cut through in the middle,\nshowing the depths of the sea and of the earth; the waters start\nfrom the bottom of the seas, and ramifying through the earth they\nrise to the summits of the mountains, flowing back by the rivers and\nreturning to the sea.\n\nObservations in support of the hypothesis (963-969).\n\n963.\n\nThe waters circulate with constant motion from the utmost depths of\nthe sea to the highest summits of the mountains, not obeying the\nnature of heavy matter; and in this case it acts as does the blood\nof animals which is always moving from the sea of the heart and\nflows to the top of their heads; and here it is that veins burst--as\none may see when a vein bursts in the nose, that all the blood from\nbelow rises to the level of the burst vein. When the water rushes\nout of a burst vein in the earth it obeys the nature of other things\nheavier than the air, whence it always seeks the lowest places.
