At the spot marked _A_ Leonardo wrote _corpo solare_\n(solar body) in the larger diagram and _Sole_ (sun) in the smaller\none. At _C luna_ (moon) is written and at _B terra_ (the earth).]\n\nSome might say that the air surrounding the moon as an element,\ncatches the light of the sun as our atmosphere does, and that it is\nthis which completes the luminous circle on the body of the moon.\n\nSome have thought that the moon has a light of its own, but this\nopinion is false, because they have founded it on that dim light\nseen between the hornes of the new moon, which looks dark where it\nis close to the bright part, while against the darkness of the\nbackground it looks so light that many have taken it to be a ring of\nnew radiance completing the circle where the tips of the horns\nilluminated by the sun cease to shine [Footnote 34: See Pl. CVIII,\nNo. 5.]. And this difference of background arises from the fact that\nthe portion of that background which is conterminous with the bright\npart of the moon, by comparison with that brightness looks darker\nthan it is; while at the upper part, where a portion of the luminous\ncircle is to be seen of uniform width, the result is that the moon,\nbeing brighter there than the medium or background on which it is\nseen by comparison with that darkness it looks more luminous at that\nedge than it is. And that brightness at such a time itself is\nderived from our ocean and other inland-seas. These are, at that\ntime, illuminated by the sun which is already setting in such a way\nas that the sea then fulfils the same function to the dark side of\nthe moon as the moon at its fifteenth day does to us when the sun is\nset. And the small amount of light which the dark side of the moon\nreceives bears the same proportion to the light of that side which\nis illuminated, as that... [Footnote 42: Here the text breaks off;\nlines 43-52 are written on the margin.].\n\nIf you want to see how much brighter the shaded portion of the moon\nis than the background on which it is seen, conceal the luminous\nportion of the moon with your hand or with some other more distant\nobject.\n\nOn the spots in the moon (903-907).\n\n903.\n\nTHE SPOTS ON THE MOON.\n\nSome have said that vapours rise from the moon, after the manner of\nclouds and are interposed between the moon and our eyes. But, if\nthis were the case, these spots would never be permanent, either as\nto position or form; and, seeing the moon from various aspects, even\nif these spots did not move they would change in form, as objects do\nwhich are seen from different sides.\n\n904.\n\nOF THE SPOTS ON THE MOON.\n\nOthers say that the moon is composed of more or less transparent\nparts; as though one part were something like alabaster and others\nlike crystal or glass. It would follow from this that the sun\ncasting its rays on the less transparent portions, the light would\nremain on the surface, and so the denser part would be illuminated,\nand the transparent portions would display the shadow of their\ndarker depths; and this is their account of the structure and nature\nof the moon. And this opinion has found favour with many\nphilosophers, and particularly with Aristotle, and yet it is a false\nview--for, in the various phases and frequent changes of the moon\nand sun to our eyes, we should see these spots vary, at one time\nlooking dark and at another light: they would be dark when the sun\nis in the West and the moon in the middle of the sky; for then the\ntransparent hollows would be in shadow as far as the tops of the\nedges of those transparent hollows, because the sun could not then\nfling his rays into the mouth of the hollows, which however, at full\nmoon, would be seen in bright light, at which time the moon is in\nthe East and faces the sun in the West; then the sun would\nilluminate even the lowest depths of these transparent places and\nthus, as there would be no shadows cast, the moon at these times\nwould not show us the spots in question; and so it would be, now\nmore and now less, according to the changes in the position of the\nsun to the moon, and of the moon to our eyes, as I have said above.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
