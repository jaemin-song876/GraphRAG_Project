It is an animal of\nterrible swiftness; the hunter when he finds its young ones carries\nthem off hastily, placing mirrors in the place whence he takes them,\nand at once escapes on a swift horse. The panther returning finds\nthe mirrors fixed on the ground and looking into them believes it\nsees its young; then scratching with its paws it discovers the\ncheat. Forthwith, by means of the scent of its young, it follows the\nhunter, and when this hunter sees the tigress he drops one of the\nyoung ones and she takes it, and having carried it to the den she\nimmediately returns to the hunter and does\n\n1255.\n\nthe same till he gets into his boat.\n\nCATOBLEPAS.\n\nIt is found in Ethiopia near to the source Nigricapo. It is not a\nvery large animal, is sluggish in all its parts, and its head is so\nlarge that it carries it with difficulty, in such wise that it\nalways droops towards the ground; otherwise it would be a great pest\nto man, for any one on whom it fixes its eyes dies immediately.\n[Footnote: Leonardo undoubtedly derived these remarks as to the\nCatoblepas from Pliny, Hist. Nat. VIII. 21 (al. 32): _Apud Hesperios\nAethiopas fons est Nigris_ (different readings), _ut plerique\nexistimavere, Nili caput.-----Juxta hunc fera appellatur catoblepas,\nmodica alioquin, ceterisque membris iners, caput tantum praegrave\naegre ferens; alias internecio humani generis, omnibus qui oculos\nejus videre, confestim morientibus._ Aelian, _Hist. An._ gives a far\nmore minute description of the creature, but he says that it poisons\nbeasts not by its gaze, but by its venomous breath. Athenaeus 221 B,\nmentions both. If Leonardo had known of these two passages, he would\nscarcely have omitted the poisonous breath. (H. MULLER-STRUBING.)]\n\nTHE BASILISK.\n\nThis is found in the province of Cyrenaica and is not more than 12\nfingers long. It has on its head a white spot after the fashion of a\ndiadem. It scares all serpents with its whistling. It resembles a\nsnake, but does not move by wriggling but from the centre forwards\nto the right. It is said that one\n\n1256.\n\nof these, being killed with a spear by one who was on horse-back,\nand its venom flowing on the spear, not only the man but the horse\nalso died. It spoils the wheat and not only that which it touches,\nbut where it breathes the grass dries and the stones are split.\n\nTHE WEASEL.\n\nThis beast finding the lair of the basilisk kills it with the smell\nof its urine, and this smell, indeed, often kills the weasel itself.\n\nTHE CERASTES.\n\nThis has four movable little horns; so, when it wants to feed, it\nhides under leaves all of its body except these little horns which,\nas they move, seem to the birds to be some small worms at play. Then\nthey immediately swoop down to pick them and the Cerastes suddenly\ntwines round them and encircles and devours them.\n\n1257.\n\nTHE AMPHISBOENA.\n\nThis has two heads, one in its proper place the other at the tail;\nas if one place were not enough from which to fling its venom.\n\nTHE IACULUS.\n\nThis lies on trees, and flings itself down like a dart, and pierces\nthrough the wild beast and kills them.\n\nTHE ASP.\n\nThe bite of this animal cannot be cured unless by immediately\ncutting out the bitten part. This pestilential animal has such a\nlove for its mate that they always go in company. And if, by mishap,\none of them is killed the other, with incredible swiftness, follows\nhim who has killed it; and it is so determined and eager for\nvengeance that it overcomes every difficulty, and passing by every\ntroop it seeks to hurt none but its enemy. And it will travel any\ndistance, and it is impossible to avoid it unless by crossing water\nand by very swift flight. It has its eyes turned inwards, and large\nears and it hears better than it sees.\n\n1258.\n\nTHE ICHNEUMON.\n\nThis animal is the mortal enemy of the asp. It is a native of Egypt\nand when it sees an asp near its place, it runs at once to the bed\nor mud of the Nile and with this makes itself muddy all over, then\nit dries itself in the sun, smears itself again with mud, and thus,\ndrying one after the other, it makes itself three or four coatings\nlike a coat of mail. Then it attacks the asp, and fights well with\nhim, so that, taking its time it catches him in the throat and\ndestroys him.\n\nTHE CROCODILE.\n\nThis is found in the Nile, it\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
