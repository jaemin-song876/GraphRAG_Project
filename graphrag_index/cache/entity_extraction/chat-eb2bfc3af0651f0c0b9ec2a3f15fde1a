[Footnote: The objections are very minutely noted down in the\nmanuscript, but they hardly seem to have a place here.]\n\n901.\n\nAnswer to Maestro Andrea da Imola, who said that the solar rays\nreflected from a convex mirror are mingled and lost at a short\ndistance; whereby it is altogether denied that the luminous side of\nthe moon is of the nature of a mirror, and that consequently the\nlight is not produced by the innumerable multitude of the waves of\nthat sea, which I declared to be the portion of the moon which is\nilluminated by the solar rays.\n\nLet _o p_ be the body of the sun, _c n s_ the moon, and _b_ the eye\nwhich, above the base _c n_ of the cathetus _c n m_, sees the body\nof the sun reflected at equal angles _c n_; and the same again on\nmoving the eye from _b_ to _a_. [Footnote: The large diagram on the\nmargin of page 161 belongs to this chapter.]\n\nExplanation of the lumen cinereum in the moon.\n\n902.\n\nOF THE MOON.\n\nNo solid body is less heavy than the atmosphere.\n\n[Footnote: 1. On the margin are the words _tola romantina,\ntola--ferro stagnato_ (tinned iron); _romantina_ is some special\nkind of sheet-iron no longer known by that name.]\n\nHaving proved that the part of the moon that shines consists of\nwater, which mirrors the body of the sun and reflects the radiance\nit receives from it; and that, if these waters were devoid of waves,\nit would appear small, but of a radiance almost like the sun; --[5]\nIt must now be shown whether the moon is a heavy or a light body:\nfor, if it were a heavy body--admitting that at every grade of\ndistance from the earth greater levity must prevail, so that water\nis lighter than the earth, and air than water, and fire than air and\nso on successively--it would seem that if the moon had density as it\nreally has, it would have weight, and having weight, that it could\nnot be sustained in the space where it is, and consequently that it\nwould fall towards the centre of the universe and become united to\nthe earth; or if not the moon itself, at least its waters would fall\naway and be lost from it, and descend towards the centre, leaving\nthe moon without any and so devoid of lustre. But as this does not\nhappen, as might in reason be expected, it is a manifest sign that\nthe moon is surrounded by its own elements: that is to say water,\nair and fire; and thus is, of itself and by itself, suspended in\nthat part of space, as our earth with its element is in this part of\nspace; and that heavy bodies act in the midst of its elements just\nas other heavy bodies do in ours [Footnote 15: This passage would\ncertainly seem to establish Leonardo's claim to be regarded as the\noriginal discoverer of the cause of the ashy colour of the new moon\n(_lumen cinereum_). His observations however, having hitherto\nremained unknown to astronomers, Moestlin and Kepler have been\ncredited with the discoveries which they made independently a\ncentury later.\n\nSome disconnected notes treat of the same subject in MS.
