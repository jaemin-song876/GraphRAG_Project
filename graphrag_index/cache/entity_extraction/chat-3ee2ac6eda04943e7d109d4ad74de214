It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist's point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the\nother hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever\nit turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in\nthe form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective\nindependently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives\nthe images by means of the pyramid of rays \"just as a magnet\nattracts iron\".\n\nIn connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by\nthe Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and\nimportant because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this\nsubject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,\nbetray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image\nin the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).\n\n_From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and\nto the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an\nartificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same\nthing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight\nand the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as\ncomplete as it is simple and intelligible_ (86--89).\n\n_Leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective_ (90,\n91). _The last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at\nvarious distances and of the way to estimate it_ (92--109).\n\nGeneral remarks on perspective (40-41).\n\n40.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nPerspective is the best guide to the art of Painting.\n\n[Footnote: 40. Compare 53, 2.]\n\n41.\n\nThe art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat\nappear in relief and what is in relief flat.\n\nThe elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).\n\n42.\n\nAll the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of\nmathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the\nsuperficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the\npoint has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is\nto be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.\nThe line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has\nneither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,\nexcepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is\nthe junction of two lines in a point.\n\n43.\n\nA point is not part of a line.\n\n44.\n\nOF THE NATURAL POINT.\n\nThe smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points,\nand this is proved because the natural point has continuity, and any\nthing that is continuous is infinitely divisible; but the\nmathematical point is indivisible because it has no size.\n\n[Footnote: This definition was inserted by Leonardo on a MS. copy on\nparchment of the well-known _\"Trattato d'Architettura civile e\nmilitare\"_ &c. by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO; opposite a passage where the\nauthor says: _'In prima he da sapere che punto \u00e8 quella parie della\nquale he nulla--Linia he luncheza senza \u00e0pieza; &c.]\n\n45.\n\n1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the\nlimitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation\nof one body is that which begins another. 3, that which is not part\nof any body is nothing. Nothing is that which fills no space.\n\nIf one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of\nan infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite\nnumber of lines, there must be an infinite number of points\nseparable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;\nwhence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.\n\n46.\n\nThe point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies\nno space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the\nbeginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called\nnothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The\nlimitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the\nsurface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that\nbody.\n\nOf the line (47-48).\n\n47.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.\n\nThe line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather\nbe called an imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its\nnature it occupies no space. Therefore an infinite number of lines\nmay be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point, which has\nno dimensions and is only of the thickness (if thickness it may be\ncalled) of one single line.\n\nHOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?\n\nAn angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an\nangle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
