Leonardo's father Ser Piero, who afterwards\nmarried four times, had eleven children by his third and fourth wives.\nIs it unreasonable to suggest that Leonardo may have had these numbers\nin mind in 1496-1498 when he was painting in his famous \"Last Supper\"\nthe figures of eleven Apostles and one outcast?\n\nHowever, Ser Piero seems to have legitimised his \"love child\" who very\nearly showed promise of extraordinary talent and untiring energy.\n\n\n\n\nHIS EARLY TRAINING\n\nPractically nothing is known about Leonardo's boyhood, but Vasari\ninforms us that Ser Piero, impressed with the remarkable character of\nhis son's genius, took some of his drawings to Andrea del Verrocchio,\nan intimate friend, and begged him earnestly to express an opinion on\nthem. Verrocchio was so astonished at the power they revealed that he\nadvised Ser Piero to send Leonardo to study under him. Leonardo thus\nentered the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio about 1469-1470. In the\nworkshop of that great Florentine sculptor, goldsmith, and artist he\nmet other craftsmen, metal workers, and youthful painters, among whom\nwas Botticelli, at that moment of his development a jovial\n_habitue_ of the Poetical Supper Club, who had not yet given any\npremonitions of becoming the poet, mystic, and visionary of later\ntimes. There also Leonardo came into contact with that unoriginal\npainter Lorenzo di Credi, his junior by seven years. He also, no\ndoubt, met Perugino, whom Michelangelo called \"that blockhead in art.\"\nThe genius and versatility of the Vincian painter was, however, in no\nway dulled by intercourse with lesser artists than himself; on the\ncontrary he vied with each in turn, and readily outstripped his fellow\npupils. In 1472, at the age of twenty, he was admitted into the Guild\nof Florentine Painters.\n\nUnfortunately very few of Leonardo's paintings have come down to us.\nIndeed there do not exist a sufficient number of finished and\nabsolutely authentic oil pictures from his own hand to afford\nillustrations for this short chronological sketch of his life's work.\nThe few that do remain, however, are of so exquisite a quality--or\nwere until they were \"comforted\" by the uninspired restorer--that we\ncan unreservedly accept the enthusiastic records of tradition in\nrespect of all his works. To rightly understand the essential\ncharacteristics of Leonardo's achievements it is necessary to\nregard him as a scientist quite as much as an artist, as a philosopher\nno less than a painter, and as a draughtsman rather than a colourist.\nThere is hardly a branch of human learning to which he did not at\none time or another give his eager attention, and he was engrossed in\nturn by the study of architecture--the foundation-stone of all true\nart--sculpture, mathematics, engineering and music. His versatility\nwas unbounded, and we are apt to regret that this many-sided genius\ndid not realise that it is by developing his power within certain\nlimits that the great master is revealed. Leonardo may be described as\nthe most Universal Genius of Christian times-perhaps of all time.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE III.-THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS\n\nIn the National Gallery.

That it was\npainted in the studio of Verrocchio was always admitted, but it was\nlong catalogued by the Louvre authorities under the name of Lorenzo di\nCredi. It is now, however, attributed to Leonardo (No. 1602 A). Such\nuncertainties as to attribution were common half a century ago when\nscientific art criticism was in its infancy.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
