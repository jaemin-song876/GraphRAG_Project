Its own weight almost suffices to move it\ndownwards.\n\nThe muscle _d_ acts with the muscle _c_ when the arm moves forward;\nand in moving backward the muscle _b_ acts with the muscle _c_.\n\n[Footnote: See Pl.

The navel does not change its position to the male organ; and\nthis shrinking arises because when a figure stands on one foot, that\nfoot becomes the centre [of gravity] of the superimposed weight.\nThis being so, the middle between the shoulders is thrust above it\nout of it perpendicular line, and this line, which forms the central\nline of the external parts of the body, becomes bent at its upper\nextremity [so as to be] above the foot which supports the body; and\nthe transverse lines are forced into such angles that their ends are\nlower on the side which is supported.
