XXIX), representing a landscape with storm-clouds, may serve to\nillustrate this section as well as the following one.]\n\n477.\n\nOF CLOUDS, SMOKE AND DUST AND THE FLAMES OF A FURNACE OR OF A\nBURNING KILN.\n\nThe clouds do not show their rounded forms excepting on the sides\nwhich face the sun; on the others the roundness is imperceptible\nbecause they are in the shade. [Footnote: The text of this chapter\nis given in facsimile on Pls. XXXVI and XXXVII. The two halves of\nthe leaf form but one in the original. On the margin close to lines\n4 and 5 is the note: _rossore d'aria inverso l'orizonte_--(of the\nredness of the atmosphere near the horizon). The sketches on the\nlower portion of the page will be spoken of in No. 668.]\n\nIf the sun is in the East and the clouds in the West, the eye placed\nbetween the sun and the clouds sees the edges of the rounded forms\ncomposing these clouds as dark, and the portions which are\nsurrounded by this dark [edge] are light. And this occurs because\nthe edges of the rounded forms of these clouds are turned towards\nthe upper or lateral sky, which is reflected in them.\n\nBoth the cloud and the tree display no roundness at all on their\nshaded side.\n\nOn images reflected in water.\n\n478.\n\nPainters often deceive themselves, by representing water in which\nthey make the water reflect the objects seen by the man. But the\nwater reflects the object from one side and the man sees it from the\nother; and it often happens that the painter sees an object from\nbelow, and thus one and the same object is seen from hind part\nbefore and upside down, because the water shows the image of the\nobject in one way, and the eye sees it in another.\n\nOf rainbows and rain (479. 480).\n\n479.\n\nThe colours in the middle of the rainbow mingle together.\n\nThe bow in itself is not in the rain nor in the eye that sees it;\nthough it is generated by the rain, the sun, and the eye. The\nrainbow is always seen by the eye that is between the rain and the\nbody of the sun; hence if the sun is in the East and the rain is in\nthe West it will appear on the rain in the West.\n\n480.\n\nWhen the air is condensed into rain it would produce a vacuum if the\nrest of the air did not prevent this by filling its place, as it\ndoes with a violent rush; and this is the wind which rises in the\nsummer time, accompanied by heavy rain.\n\nOf flower seeds.\n\n481.\n\nAll the flowers which turn towards the sun perfect their seeds; but\nnot the others; that is to say those which get only the reflection\nof the sun.\n\nIX.\n\n_The Practice of Painting._\n\n_It is hardly necessary to offer any excuses for the division\ncarried out in the arrangement of the text into practical\nsuggestions and theoretical enquiries. It was evidently intended by\nLeonardo himself as we conclude from incidental remarks in the MSS.\n(for instance No_ 110_). The fact that this arrangement was never\ncarried out either in the old MS. copies or in any edition since, is\neasily accounted for by the general disorder which results from the\nprovisional distribution of the various chapters in the old copies.\nWe have every reason to believe that the earliest copyists, in\ndistributing the materials collected by them, did not in the least\nconsider the order in which the original MS.lay before them._\n\n_It is evident that almost all the chapters which refer to the\ncalling and life of the painter--and which are here brought together\nin the first section (Nos._ 482-508_)--may be referred to two\ndistinct periods in Leonardo's life; most of them can be dated as\nbelonging to the year_ 1492 _or to_ 1515. _At about this later time\nLeonardo may have formed the project of completing his Libro della\nPittura, after an interval of some years, as it would seem, during\nwhich his interest in the subject had fallen somewhat into the\nbackground._\n\n_In the second section, which treats first of the artist's studio,\nthe construction of a suitable window forms the object of careful\ninvestigations; the special importance attached to this by Leonardo\nis sufficiently obvious. His theory of the incidence of light which\nwas fully discussed in a former part of this work, was to him by no\nmeans of mere abstract value, but, being deduced, as he says, from\nexperience (or experiment) was required to prove its utility in\npractice. Connected with this we find suggestions for the choice of\na light with practical hints as to sketching a picture and some\nother precepts of a practical character which must come under\nconsideration in the course of completing the painting. In all this\nI have followed the same principle of arrangement in the text as was\ncarried out in the Theory of Painting, thus the suggestions for the\nPerspective of a picture, (Nos._ 536-569_), are followed by the\ntheory of light and shade for the practical method of optics (Nos._\n548--566_) and this by the practical precepts or the treatment of\naerial perspective (_567--570_)._\n\n_In the passage on Portrait and Figure Painting the principles of\npaint\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
