To prove this let _a_ and _b_ be two bodies\nplaced between the window _n m_ and the plane surface _o p_ with\nsufficient space between them as shown by the space _a b_. I say\nthat if the body _a_ is moved towards _s_ the shadow of the body _b_\nwhich is at _c_ will move towards _d_.\n\n212.\n\nOF THE MOTION OF SHADOWS.\n\nThe motion of a shadow is always more rapid than that of the body\nwhich produces it if the light is stationary. To prove this let _a_\nbe the luminous body, and _b_ the body casting the shadow, and _d_\nthe shadow. Then I say that in the time while the solid body moves\nfrom _b_ to _c_, the shadow _d_ will move to _e_; and this\nproportion in the rapidity of the movements made in the same space\nof time, is equal to that in the length of the space moved over.\nThus, given the proportion of the space moved over by the body _b_\nto _c_, to that moved over by the shadow _d_ to _e_, the proportion\nin the rapidity of their movements will be the same.\n\nBut if the luminous body is also in movement with a velocity equal\nto that of the solid body, then the shadow and the body that casts\nit will move with equal speed. And if the luminous body moves more\nrapidly than the solid body, the motion of the shadow will be slower\nthan that of the body casting it.\n\nBut if the luminous body moves more slowly than the solid body, then\nthe shadow will move more rapidly than that body.\n\nSIXTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.\n\nThe effect of rays passing through holes (213. 214).\n\n213.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nIf you transmit the rays of the sun through a hole in the shape of a\nstar you will see a beautiful effect of perspective in the spot\nwhere the sun's rays fall.\n\n[Footnote: In this and the following chapters of MS. C the order of\nthe original paging has been adhered to, and is shown in\nparenthesis. Leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject\nof these propositions. The space left for the purpose has\noccasionally been made use of for quite different matter. Even the\nnumerous diagrams, most of them very delicately sketched, lettered\nand numbered, which occur on these pages, are hardly ever explained,\nwith the exception of those few which are here given.]\n\n214.\n\nNo small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to\nprevent, at a long distance, the transmission of the true form of\nthe luminous body causing them. It is impossible that rays of light\npassing through a parallel [slit], should not display the form of\nthe body causing them, since all the effects produced by a luminous\nbody are [in fact] the reflection of that body: The moon, shaped\nlike a boat, if transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface\n[it falls on] as a boatshaped object. [Footnote 8: In the MS. a\nblank space is left after this question.] Why the eye sees bodies at\na distance, larger than they measure on the vertical plane?.\n\n[Footnote: This chapter, taken from another MS. may, as an\nexception, be placed here, as it refers to the same subject as the\npreceding section.]\n\nOn gradation of shadows (215. 216).\n\n215.\n\nAlthough the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be\nnarrower and shorter in foreshortening, the quality and quantity of\nthe light and shade is not increased nor diminished.\n\n[3]The function of shade and light when diminished by\nforeshortening, will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object\nopposite, according to the quality and quantity in which they fall\non the body.\n\n[5]In proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate\nextremities the deeper it will appear, _g z_ beyond the intersection\nfaces only the part of the shadow [marked] _y z_; this by\nintersection takes the shadow from _m n_ but by direct line it takes\nthe shadow _a m_ hence it is twice as deep as _g z_. _Y x_, by\nintersection takes the shadow _n o_, but by direct line the shadow\n_n m a_, therefore _x y_ is three times as dark as _z g_; _x f_, by\nintersection faces _o b_ and by direct line _o n m a_, therefore we\nmust say that the shadow between _f x_ will be four times as dark as\nthe shadow _z g_, because it faces four times as much shadow.\n\nLet _a b_ be the side where the primary shadow is, and _b c_ the\nprimary light, _d_ will be the spot where it is intercepted,_f g_\nthe derived shadow and _f e_ the derived light.\n\nAnd this must be at the beginning of the explanation.\n\n[Footnote: In the original MS. the text of No. 252 precedes the one\ngiven here.
