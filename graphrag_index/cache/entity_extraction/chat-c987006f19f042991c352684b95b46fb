If the non-existence of the two pictures here\nalluded to justifies my hypothesis that only studies for such\npictures are meant by the text, it may also be supposed that the\ndrawings were made for some comrade in VERROCCHIO'S atelier. (See\nVASARI, Sansoni's ed. Florence 1880. Vol. IV, p. 564): \"_E perche a\nLerenzo piaceva fuor di modo la maniera di Lionardo, la seppe cosi\nbene imitare, che niuno fu che nella pulitezza e nel finir l'opere\ncon diligenza l'imitasse pi\u00f9 di lui_.\" Leonardo's notes give me no\nopportunity of discussing the pictures executed by him in Florence,\nbefore he moved to Milan. So the studies for the unfinished picture\nof the Adoration of the Magi--in the Uffizi, Florence--cannot be\ndescribed here, nor would any discussion about the picture in the\nLouvre \"_La Vierge aux Rochers_\" be appropriate in the absence of\nall allusion to it in the MSS. Therefore, when I presently add a few\nremarks on this painting in explanation of the Master's drawings for\nit, it will be not merely with a view to facilitate critical\nresearches about the picture now in the National Gallery, London,\nwhich by some critics has been pronounced to be a replica of the\nLouvre picture, but also because I take this opportunity of\npublishing several finished studies of the Master's which, even if\nthey were not made in Florence but later in Milan, must have been\nprior to the painting of the Last Supper. The original picture in\nParis is at present so disfigured by dust and varnish that the\ncurrent reproductions in photography actually give evidence more of\nthe injuries to which the picture has been exposed than of the\noriginal work itself. The wood-cut given on p. 344, is only intended\nto give a general notion of the composition. It must be understood\nthat the outline and expression of the heads, which in the picture\nis obscured but not destroyed, is here altogether missed. The\nfacsimiles which follow are from drawings which appear to me to be\nstudies for \"_La Vierge aux Rochers_.\"\n\n1. A drawing in silver point on brown toned paper of a woman's head\nlooking to the left. In the Royal Library at Turin, apparently a\nstudy from nature for the Angel's head (Pl. XLII).\n\n2. A study of drapery for the left leg of the same figure, done with\nthe brush, Indian ink on greenish paper, the lights heightened with\nwhite.\n\nThe original is at Windsor, No. 223. The reproduction Pl. XLIII is\ndefective in the shadow on the upper part of the thigh, which is not\nso deep as in the original; it should also be observed that the\nfolds of the drapery near the hips are somewhat altered in the\nfinished work in the Louvre, while the London copy shows a greater\nresemblance to this study in that particular.\n\n3. A study in red chalk for the bust of the Infant Christ--No. 3 in\nthe Windsor collection (Pl. XLIV). The well-known silver-point\ndrawing on pale green paper, in the Louvre, of a boy's head (No. 363\nin REISET, _Notice des dessins, Ecoles d'Italie_) seems to me to be\na slightly altered copy, either from the original picture or from\nthis red chalk study.\n\n4. A silver-point study on greenish paper, for the head of John the\nBaptist, reproduced on p. 342. This was formerly in the Codex\nVallardi and is now exhibited among the drawings in the Louvre. The\nlights are, in the original, heightened with white; the outlines,\nparticularly round the head and ear, are visibly restored.\n\nThere is a study of an outstretched hand--No. 288 in the Windsor\ncollection--which was published in the Grosvenor Gallery\nPublication, 1878, simply under the title of: \"No. 72 Study of a\nhand, pointing\" which, on the other hand, I regard as a copy by a\npupil. The action occurs in the kneeling angel of the Paris picture\nand not in the London copy.\n\nThese four genuine studies form, I believe, a valuable substitute in\nthe absence of any MS. notes referring to the celebrated Paris\npicture.]\n\nBernardo di Bandino's Portrait.\n\n664.\n\nA tan-coloured small cap, A doublet of black serge, A black jerkin\nlined A blue coat lined, with fur of foxes' breasts, and the collar\nof the jerkin covered with black and white stippled velvet Bernardo\ndi Bandino Baroncelli; black hose.\n\n[Footnote: These eleven lines of text are by the side of the pen and\nink drawing of a man hanged--Pl. LXII, No. 1. This drawing was\nexhibited in 1879 at the _Ecole des Beaux-Arts_ in Paris and the\ncompilers of the catalogue amused themselves by giving the victim's\nname as follows: \"_Un pendu, vetu d'une longue robe, les mains li\u00e9es\nsur le dos ...
