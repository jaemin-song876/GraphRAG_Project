X._ C. 14 (p. 264 in the edition of Rose and\nMuller- Strubing). The German edition published at Bale in 1543 has,\non fol. 596, an illustration of the contrivance, as described by\nVitruvius.] gives one in his work on Architecture which is just as\nfallacious as all the others; and this is a mill wheel which touches\nthe waves of the sea at one end and in each complete revolution\ndescribes a straight line which represents the circumference of the\nwheel extended to a straightness. But this invention is of no worth\nexcepting on the smooth and motionless surface of lakes. But if the\nwater moves together with the ship at an equal rate, then the wheel\nremains motionless; and if the motion of the water is more or less\nrapid than that of the ship, then neither has the wheel the same\nmotion as the ship so that this invention is of but little use.\nThere is another method tried by experiment with a known distance\nbetween one island and another; and this is done by a board or under\nthe pressure of wind which strikes on it with more or less\nswiftness. This is in Battista Alberti [Footnote 25: LEON BATTISTA\nALBERTI, _De Architectura lib. V._, c. 12 treats '_de le navi e\nparti loro_', but there is no reference to the machine, mentioned by\nLeonardo. Alberti says here: _Noi abbiamo trattato lungamente in\naltro luogo de' modi de le navi, ma in questo luogo ne abbiamo detto\nquel tanto che si bisogna_. To this the following note is added in\nthe most recent Italian edition: _Questo libro e tuttora inedito e\nporta il titolo, secondo Gesnero di_ '_Liber navis_'.].\n\nBattista Alberti's method which is made by experiment on a known\ndistance between one island and another. But such an invention does\nnot succeed excepting on a ship like the one on which the experiment\nwas made, and it must be of the same burden and have the same sails,\nand the sails in the same places, and the size of the waves must be\nthe same. But my method will serve for any ship, whether with oars\nor sails; and whether it be small or large, broad or long, or high\nor low, it always serves [Footnote 52: Leonardo does not reveal the\nmethod invented by him.].\n\nMethods of staying and moving in water\n\n1114.\n\nHow an army ought to cross rivers by swimming with air-bags ... How\nfishes swim [Footnote 2: Compare No. 821.]; of the way in which they\njump out of the water, as may be seen with dolphins; and it seems a\nwonderful thing to make a leap from a thing which does not resist\nbut slips away. Of the swimming of animals of a long form, such as\neels and the like. Of the mode of swimming against currents and in\nthe rapid falls of rivers. Of the mode of swimming of fishes of a\nround form. How it is that animals which have not long hind quartres\ncannot swim. How it is that all other animals which have feet with\ntoes, know by nature how to swim, excepting man. In what way man\nought to learn to swim. Of the way in which man may rest on the\nwater. How man may protect himself against whirlpools or eddies in\nthe water, which drag him down. How a man dragged to the bottom must\nseek the reflux which will throw him up from the depths. How he\nought to move his arms. How to swim on his back. How he can and how\nhe cannot stay under water unless he can hold his breath [13]. How\nby means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under\nwater.
