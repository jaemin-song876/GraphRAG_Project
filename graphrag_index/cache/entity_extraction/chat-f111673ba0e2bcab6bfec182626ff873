Inasmuch as they\nrepresent one historical subject on one level with a landscape and\nbuildings, and then go up a step and paint another, varying the\npoint [of sight], and then a third and a fourth, in such a way as\nthat on one wall there are 4 points of sight, which is supreme folly\nin such painters. We know that the point of sight is opposite the\neye of the spectator of the scene; and if you would [have me] tell\nyou how to represent the life of a saint divided into several\npictures on one and the same wall, I answer that you must set out\nthe foreground with its point of sight on a level with the eye of\nthe spectator of the scene, and upon this plane represent the more\nimportant part of the story large and then, diminishing by degrees\nthe figures, and the buildings on various hills and open spaces, you\ncan represent all the events of the history. And on the remainder of\nthe wall up to the top put trees, large as compared with the\nfigures, or angels if they are appropriate to the story, or birds or\nclouds or similar objects; otherwise do not trouble yourself with it\nfor your whole work will be wrong.\n\n543.\n\nA PICTURE OF OBJECTS IN PERSPECTIVE WILL LOOK MORE LIFELIKE WHEN\nSEEN FROM THE POINT FROM WHICH THE OBJECTS WERE DRAWN.\n\nIf you want to represent an object near to you which is to have the\neffect of nature, it is impossible that your perspective should not\nlook wrong, with every false relation and disagreement of proportion\nthat can be imagined in a wretched work, unless the spectator, when\nhe looks at it, has his eye at the very distance and height and\ndirection where the eye or the point of sight was placed in doing\nthis perspective. Hence it would be necessary to make a window, or\nrather a hole, of the size of your face through which you can look\nat the work; and if you do this, beyond all doubt your work, if it\nis correct as to light and shade, will have the effect of nature;\nnay you will hardly persuade yourself that those objects are\npainted; otherwise do not trouble yourself about it, unless indeed\nyou make your view at least 20 times as far off as the greatest\nwidth or height of the objects represented, and this will satisfy\nany spectator placed anywhere opposite to the picture.\n\nIf you want the proof briefly shown, take a piece of wood in the\nform of a little column, eight times as high as it is thick, like a\ncolumn without any plinth or capital; then mark off on a flat wall\n40 equal spaces, equal to its width so that between them they make\n40 columns resembling your little column; you then must fix,\nopposite the centre space, and at 4 braccia from the wall, a thin\nstrip of iron with a small round hole in the middle about as large\nas a big pearl. Close to this hole place a light touching it. Then\nplace your column against each mark on the wall and draw the outline\nof its shadow; afterwards shade it and look through the hole in the\niron plate.\n\n[Footnote: In the original there is a wide space between lines 3 and\n4 in which we find two sketches not belonging to the text. It is\nunnecessary to give prominence to the points in which my reading\ndiffers from that of M. RAVAISSON or to justify myself, since they\nare all of secondary importance and can also be immediately verified\nfrom the photograph facsimile in his edition.]\n\n544.\n\nA diminished object should be seen from the same distance, height\nand direction as the point of sight of your eye, or else your\nknowledge will produce no good effect.\n\nAnd if you will not, or cannot, act on this principle--because as\nthe plane on which you paint is to be seen by several persons you\nwould need several points of sight which would make it look\ndiscordant and wrong--place yourself at a distance of at least 10\ntimes the size of the objects.\n\nThe lesser fault you can fall into then, will be that of\nrepresenting all the objects in the foreground of their proper size,\nand on whichever side you are standing the objects thus seen will\ndiminish themselves while the spaces between them will have no\ndefinite ratio. For, if you place yourself in the middle of a\nstraight row [of objects], and look at several columns arranged in a\nline you will see, beyond a few columns separated by intervals, that\nthe columns touch; and beyond where they touch they cover each\nother, till the last column projects but very little beyond the last\nbut one. Thus the spaces between the columns are by degrees entirely\nlost. So, if your method of perspective is good, it will produce the\nsame effect; this effect results from standing near the line in\nwhich the columns are placed. This method is not satisfactory unless\nthe objects seen are viewed from a small hole, in the middle of\nwhich is your point of sight; but if you proceed thus your work will\nbe perfect and will deceive the beholder, who will see the columns\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
