Fr. FERRARA, _Descrizione dell' Etna con la\nstoria delle *eruzioni_ (Palermo, 1818, p. 88) tells us, on the\nauthority of the _Cronaca del Monastero Benedettino di Licordia_ of\nan eruption of the Volcano with a great flow of lava on Sept. 21,\n1447. The next records of the mountain are from the years 1533 and\n1536. A. Percy neither does mention any eruptions of Etna during the\nyears to which this note must probably refer _Memoire des\ntremblements de terre de la peninsule italique, Vol. XXII des\nMemoires couronnees et Memoires des savants etrangers. Academie\nRoyal de Belgique_).\n\nA literal interpretation of the passage would not, however, indicate\nan allusion to any great eruption; particularly in the connection\nwith Stromboli, where the periodical outbreaks in very short\nintervals are very striking to any observer, especially at night\ntime, when passing the island on the way from Naples to Messina.],\nrejecting the ill-restained element vomit it forth, back to its own\nregion, driving furiously before it every obstacle that comes in the\nway of its impetuous rage ...\n\nUnable to resist my eager desire and wanting to see the great ... of\nthe various and strange shapes made by formative nature, and having\nwandered some distance among gloomy rocks, I came to the entrance of\na great cavern, in front of which I stood some time, astonished and\nunaware of such a thing. Bending my back into an arch I rested my\nleft hand on my knee and held my right hand over my down-cast and\ncontracted eye brows: often bending first one way and then the\nother, to see whether I could discover anything inside, and this\nbeing forbidden by the deep darkness within, and after having\nremained there some time, two contrary emotions arose in me, fear\nand desire--fear of the threatening dark cavern, desire to see\nwhether there were any marvellous thing within it ...\n\nDrafts of Letters to Lodovico il Moro (1340-1345).\n\n1340.\n\nMost illustrious Lord, Having now sufficiently considered the\nspecimens of all those who proclaim themselves skilled contrivers of\ninstruments of war, and that the invention and operation of the said\ninstruments are nothing different to those in common use: I shall\nendeavour, without prejudice to any one else, to explain myself to\nyour Excellency showing your Lordship my secrets, and then offering\nthem to your best pleasure and approbation to work with effect at\nopportune moments as well as all those things which, in part, shall\nbe briefly noted below.\n\n[Footnote: The numerous corrections, the alterations in the figures\n(l. 18) and the absence of any signature prove that this is merely\nthe rough draft of a letter to Lodovico il Moro. It is one of the\nvery few manuscripts which are written from left to right--see the\nfacsimile of the beginning as here reproduced. This is probably the\nfinal sketch of a document the clean of which copy was written in\nthe usual manner. Leonardo no doubt very rarely wrote so, and this\nis probably the reason of the conspicuous dissimilarity in the\nhandwriting, when he did. (Compare Pl. XXXVIII.) It is noteworthy\ntoo that here the orthography and abbreviations are also\nexceptional. But such superficial peculiarities are not enough to\nstamp the document as altogether spurious. It is neither a forgery\nnor the production of any artist but Leonardo himself. As to this\npoint the contents leave us no doubt as to its authenticity,\nparticularly l. 32 (see No. 719, where this passage is repeated).\nBut whether the fragment, as we here see it, was written from\nLeonardo's dictation--a theory favoured by the orthography, the\nerasures and corrections--or whether it may be a copy made for or by\nMelzi or Mazenta is comparatively unimportant. There are in the\nCodex Atlanticus a few other documents not written by Leonardo\nhimself, but the notes in his own hand found on the reverse pages of\nthese leaves amply prove that they were certainly in Leonardo's\npossession. This mark of ownership is wanting to the text in\nquestion, but the compilers of the Codex Atlanticus, at any rate,\naccepted it as a genuine document.\n\nWith regard to the probable date of this projected letter see\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
