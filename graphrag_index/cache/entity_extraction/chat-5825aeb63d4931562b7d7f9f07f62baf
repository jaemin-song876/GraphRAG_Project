And the second advantage is, that as\nthese shoots develop in the following year one will not cover the\nnext below, since the 5 come forth on five different sides; and the\nsixth which is above the first is at some distance.\n\n416.\n\nOF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF TREES AND THEIR FOLIAGE.\n\nThe ramifications of any tree, such as the elm, are wide and slender\nafter the manner of a hand with spread fingers, foreshortened. And\nthese are seen in the distribution [thus]: the lower portions are\nseen from above; and those that are above are seen from below; and\nthose in the middle, some from below and some from above. The upper\npart is the extreme [top] of this ramification and the middle\nportion is more foreshortened than any other of those which are\nturned with their tips towards you. And of those parts of the middle\nof the height of the tree, the longest will be towards the top of\nthe tree and will produce a ramification like the foliage of the\ncommon willow, which grows on the banks of rivers.\n\nOther ramifications are spherical, as those of such trees as put\nforth their shoots and leaves in the order of the sixth being placed\nabove the first. Others are thin and light like the willow and\nothers.\n\n417.\n\nYou will see in the lower branches of the elder, which puts forth\nleaves two and two placed crosswise [at right angles] one above\nanother, that if the stem rises straight up towards the sky this\norder never fails; and its largest leaves are on the thickest part\nof the stem and the smallest on the slenderest part, that is towards\nthe top. But, to return to the lower branches, I say that the leaves\non these are placed on them crosswise like [those on] the upper\nbranches; and as, by the law of all leaves, they are compelled to\nturn their upper surface towards the sky to catch the dew at night,\nit is necessary that those so placed should twist round and no\nlonger form a cross.\n\n[Footnote: See Pl. XXVII, No. 5.]\n\n418.\n\nA leaf always turns its upper side towards the sky so that it may\nthe better receive, on all its surface, the dew which drops gently\nfrom the atmosphere. And these leaves are so distributed on the\nplant as that one shall cover the other as little as possible, but\nshall lie alternately one above another as may be seen in the ivy\nwhich covers the walls. And this alternation serves two ends; that\nis, to leave intervals by which the air and sun may penetrate\nbetween them. The 2nd reason is that the drops which fall from the\nfirst leaf may fall onto the fourth or--in other trees--onto the\nsixth.\n\n419.\n\nEvery shoot and every fruit is produced above the insertion [in the\naxil] of its leaf which serves it as a mother, giving it water from\nthe rain and moisture from the dew which falls at night from above,\nand often it protects them against the too great heat of the rays of\nthe sun.\n\nLIGHT ON BRANCHES AND LEAVES (420--422).\n\n420.\n\nThat part of the body will be most illuminated which is hit by the\nluminous ray coming between right angles.\n\n[Footnote: See Pl. XXVIII, No. 1.]\n\n421.\n\nYoung plants have more transparent leaves and a more lustrous bark\nthan old ones; and particularly the walnut is lighter coloured in\nMay than in September.\n\n422.\n\nOF THE ACCIDENTS OF COLOURING IN TREES.\n\nThe accidents of colour in the foliage of trees are 4. That is:\nshadow, light, lustre [reflected light] and transparency.\n\nOF THE VISIBILITY OF THESE ACCIDENTS.\n\nThese accidents of colour in the foliage of trees become confused at\na great distance and that which has most breadth [whether light or\nshade, &c.] will be most conspicuous.\n\nThe proportions of light and shade in a leaf (423-426).\n\n423.\n\nOF THE SHADOWS OF A LEAF.\n\nSometimes a leaf has three accidents [of light] that is: shade,\nlustre [reflected light] and transparency [transmitted light]. Thus,\nif the light were at _n_ as regards the leaf _s_, and the eye at\n_m_, it would see _a_ in full light, _b_ in shadow and _c_\ntransparent.\n\n424.\n\nA leaf with a concave surface seen from the under side and\nup-side-down will sometimes show itself as half in shade, and half\ntransparent. Thus, if _o p_ is the leaf and the light _m_ and the\neye _n_, this will see _o_ in shadow because the light does not fall\nupon it between equal angles, neither on the upper nor the under\nside, and _p_ is lighted on the upper side and the light is\ntransmitted to its under side.

In the original they are drawn in red\nchalk.]\n\n425.\n\nAlthough those leaves which have a polished surface are to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
