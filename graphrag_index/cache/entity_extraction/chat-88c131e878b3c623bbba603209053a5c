In two Catalonian Portulans in the Bibliotheque\nNatio- nale in Paris-one dating from the XV'h century, by Wilhelm\nvon Soler, the other by Olivez de Majorca, in l584-I find this place\ncalled Calandra. But Leonardo's Calindra must certainly have lain\nmore to the North West, probably somewhere in Kurdistan. The fact\nthat the geographical position is so care- fully determined by\nLeonardo seems to prove that it was a place of no great importance\nand little known. It is singular that the words first written in 1.\n8 were divisa dal lago (Lake Van?), altered afterwards to\ndall'Eitfrates.\n\nNostri confini, and in 1. 6 proposito nostro. These refer to the\nfrontier and to the affairs of the Mamelook Sultan, Lines 65 and 66\nthrow some light on the purpose of Leonardo's mission.\n\n8. _I_ corni del gra mote Tauro. Compare the sketches PI.\nCXVI-CXVIII. So long as it is im- possible to identify the situation\nof Calindra it is most difficult to decide with any certainty which\npeak of the Taurus is here meant; and I greatly regret that I had no\nforeknowledge of this puzzling topographical question when, in 1876,\nI was pursuing archaeological enquiries in the Provinces of Aleppo\nand Cilicia, and had to travel for some time in view of the imposing\nsnow-peaks of Bulghar Dagh and Ala Tepessi.\n\n9-10. The opinion here expressed as to the height of the mountain\nwould be unmeaning, unless it had been written before Leonardo moved\nto Milan, where Monte Rosa is so conspicuous an the sun always fall\nupon it on its East side, four hours before day-time, and being of\nthe whitest stone [Footnote II:_Pietra bianchissima_. The Taurus\nMountains consist in great part of limestone.] it shines\nresplendently and fulfils the function to these Armenians which a\nbright moon-light would in the midst of the darkness; and by its\ngreat height it outreaches the utmost level of the clouds by a space\nof four miles in a straight line. This peak is seen in many places\ntowards the West, illuminated by the sun after its setting the third\npart of the night. This it is, which with you [Footnote 14:\n_Appresso di voi_. Leonardo had at first written _noi_ as though his\nmeaning had,been: This peak appeared to us to be a comet when you\nand I observed it in North Syria (at Aleppo? at Aintas?). The\ndescription of the curious reflection in the evening, resembling the\n\"Alpine-glow\" is certainly not an invented fiction, for in the next\nlines an explanation of the phenomenon is offered, or at least\nattempted.] we formerly in calm weather had supposed to be a comet,\nand appears to us in the darkness of night, to change its form,\nbeing sometimes divided in two or three parts, and sometimes long\nand sometimes short. And this is caused by the clouds on the horizon\nof the sky which interpose between part of this mountain and the\nsun, and by cutting off some of the solar rays the light on the\nmountain is intercepted by various intervals of clouds, and\ntherefore varies in the form of its brightness.\n\nTHE DIVISIONS OF THE BOOK [Footnote 19: The next 33 lines are\nevidently the contents of a connected Report or Book, but not of one\nwhich he had at hand; more probably, indeed, of one he purposed\nwriting.].\n\nThe praise and confession of the faith [Footnote 20: _Persuasione di\nfede_, of the Christian or the Mohammedan faith?
