Ravaisson who gave a French translation of it\nin the _Gazette des Beaux Arts_ (1881, pag. 528), remarks as\nfollows: _Le maitre sculpteur que Leonard appelle son \"compare\" ne\nserait-il pas Benedetto da Majano, un de ceux qui jugerent avec lui\nde la place a donner au David de Michel-Ange, et de qui le Louvre a\nacquis recemment un buste d'apres Philippe Strozzi?_ To this it may\nbe objected that Benedetto da Majano had already lain in his grave\nfourteen years, in the year 1511, when he is supposed to have given\nthe promise to Leonardo. The colours may have been given to the\nsculptor Benedetto and the stone may have been in payment for them.\n>From the description of the stone here given we may conclude that it\nis repeated from hearsay of the sculptor's account of it. I do not\nunderstand how, from this observation, it is possible to conclude\nthat Leonardo was on the spot.]\n\n1058.\n\nThat there are springs which suddenly break forth in earthquakes or\nother convulsions and suddenly fail; and this happened in a mountain\nin Savoy where certain forests sank in and left a very deep gap, and\nabout four miles from here the earth opened itself like a gulf in\nthe mountain, and threw out a sudden and immense flood of water\nwhich scoured the whole of a little valley of the tilled soil,\nvineyards and houses, and did the greatest mischief, wherever it\noverflowed.\n\n1059.\n\nThe river Arve, a quarter of a mile from Geneva in Savoy, where the\nfair is held on midsummerday in the village of Saint Gervais.\n\n[Footnote: An indistinct sketch is to be seen by the text.]\n\n1060.\n\nAnd this may be seen, as I saw it, by any one going up Monbroso\n[Footnote: I have vainly enquired of every available authority for a\nsolution of the mystery as to what mountain is intended by the name\nMonboso (Comp.

The base of this mountain gives\nbirth to the 4 rivers which flow in four different directions\nthrough the whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base at so\ngreat a height as this, which lifts itself above almost all the\nclouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer,\nwhen the clouds are highest. And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so\nthat if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling\nclouds, which does not happen more than twice in an age, an enormous\nmass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of hail, and in\nthe middle of July I found it very considerable; and I saw the sky\nabove me quite dark, and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far\nbrighter here than in the plains below, because a smaller extent of\natmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun.\n[Footnote 6: _in una eta._ This is perhaps a slip of the pen on\nLeonardo's part and should be read _estate_ (summer).]\n\nLeic. 9b]\n\n1061.\n\nIn the mountains of Verona the red marble is found all mixed with\ncockle shells turned into stone;\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
