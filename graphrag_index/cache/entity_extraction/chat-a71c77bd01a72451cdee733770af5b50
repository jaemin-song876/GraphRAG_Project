Now here, in this shadow, we see\nthe converse of this, in as much as where this derived shadow\noriginates we obviously have the figures of two pyramids of shadow\nwhich meet at their angles. Hence, if, as [my] opponent says, the\nfirst pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative shadow at the\nangle whence it starts, then the second pyramid of shadow--so says\nthe adversary--must be caused by the angle and not from the body in\nshadow; and this is disproved with the help of the 2nd of this which\nsays: Shadow is a condition produced by a body casting a shadow, and\ninterposed between this shadow and the luminous body. By this it is\nmade clear that the shadow is not produced by the angle of the\nderived shadow but only by the body casting the shadow; &c. If a\nspherical solid body is illuminated by a light of elongated form the\nshadow produced by the longest portion of this light will have less\ndefined outlines than that which is produced by the breadth of the\nsame light. And this is proved by what was said before, which is:\nThat a shadow will have less defined outlines in proportion as the\nlight which causes it is larger, and conversely, the outlines are\nclearer in proportion as it is smaller.\n\n[Footnote: The two diagrams to this chapter are on Plate IV, No. 1.]\n\nOn the relation of derived and primary shadow (163-165).\n\n163.\n\nThe derived shadow can never resemble the body from which it\nproceeds unless the light is of the same form and size as the body\ncausing the shadow.\n\nThe derived shadow cannot be of the same form as the primary shadow\nunless it is intercepted by a plane parallel to it.\n\n164.\n\nHOW A CAST SHADOW CAN NEVER BE OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE BODY THAT\nCASTS IT.\n\nIf the rays of light proceed, as experience shows, from a single\npoint and are diffused in a sphere round this point, radiating and\ndispersed through the air, the farther they spread the wider they\nmust spread; and an object placed between the light and a wall is\nalways imaged larger in its shadow, because the rays that strike it\n[Footnote: 7. The following lines are wanting to complete the\nlogical connection.] would, by the time they have reached the wall,\nhave become larger.\n\n165.\n\nAny shadow cast by a body in light and shade is of the same nature\nand character as that which is inseparable from the body. The centre\nof the length of a shadow always corresponds to that of the luminous\nbody [Footnote 6: This second statement of the same idea as in the\nformer sentence, but in different words, does not, in the original,\ncome next to the foregoing; sections 172 and 127 are placed between\nthem.]. It is inevitable that every shadow must have its centre in a\nline with the centre of the light.\n\nOn the shape of derived shadows (166-174).\n\n166.\n\nOF THE PYRAMIDAL SHADOW.\n\nThe pyramidal shadow produced by a columnar body will be narrower\nthan the body itself in proportion as the simple derived shadow is\nintersected farther from the body which casts it.\n\n[Footnote 166: Compare the first diagram to No. 161. If we here\nconceive of the outlines of the pyramid of shadow on the ground as\nprolonged beyond its apex this gives rise to a second pyramid; this\nis what is spoken of at the beginning of No. 166.]\n\n167.\n\nThe cast shadow will be longest when the light is lowest.\n\nThe cast shadow will be shortest when the light is highest.\n\n168.\n\nBoth the primary and derived shadow will be larger when caused by\nthe light of a candle than by diffused light. The difference between\nthe larger and smaller shadows will be in inverse proportion to the\nlarger and smaller lights causing them.\n\n[Footnote: In the diagrams _A_ stands for _celo_ (sky), _B_ for\n_cadela_ (candle).]\n\n169.\n\nALL BODIES, IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE NEARER TO, OR FARTHER FROM THE\nSOURCE OF LIGHT, WILL PRODUCE LONGER OR SHORTER DERIVED SHADOWS.\n\nAmong bodies of equal size, that one which is illuminated by the\nlargest light will have the shortest shadow. Experiment confirms\nthis proposition. Thus the body _m_ _n_ is surrounded by a larger\namount of light than the body _p q_, as is shown above. Let us say\nthat _v c a b d x_ is the sky, the source of light, and that _s t_\nis a window by which the luminous rays enter, and so _m n_ and _p q_\nare bodies in light and shade as exposed to this light; _m n_ will\nhave a small derived shadow, because its original shadow will be\nsmall; and the derivative light will be large, again, because the\noriginal light _c d_ will be large and _p q_ will have more derived\nshadow because its original shadow will be larger, and its derived\nlight will be smaller than that of the body _m n_ because that\nportion of the hemisphere _a b_ which illuminates it is smaller than\nthe hemisphere _c d_ which illuminates the body _m n_.\n\n[Footnote: The diagram, given on Pl.
