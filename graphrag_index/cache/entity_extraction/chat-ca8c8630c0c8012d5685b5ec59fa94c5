But as experience teaches us that it does not\ndie, as is evident by fire, which does not consume it, and by water\nwhich becomes salt in proportion to the quantity dissolved in\nit,--and when it is evaporated the salt always remains in the\noriginal quantity--it must pass through the bodies of men either in\nthe urine or the sweat or other excretions where it is found again;\nand as much salt is thus got rid of as is carried every year into\ntowns; therefore salt is dug in places where there is urine.-- Sea\nhogs and sea winds are salt.\n\nWe will say that the rains which penetrate the earth are what is\nunder the foundations of cities with their inhabitants, and are what\nrestore through the internal passages of the earth the saltness\ntaken from the sea; and that the change in the place of the sea,\nwhich has been over all the mountains, caused it to be left there in\nthe mines found in those mountains, &c.\n\nThe characteristics of sea water (948. 949).\n\n948.\n\nThe waters of the salt sea are fresh at the greatest depths.\n\n949.\n\nTHAT THE OCEAN DOES NOT PENETRATE UNDER THE EARTH.\n\nThe ocean does not penetrate under the earth, and this we learn from\nthe many and various springs of fresh water which, in many parts of\nthe ocean make their way up from the bottom to the surface. The same\nthing is farther proved by wells dug beyond the distance of a mile\nfrom the said ocean, which fill with fresh water; and this happens\nbecause the fresh water is lighter than salt water and consequently\nmore penetrating.\n\nWhich weighs most, water when frozen or when not frozen?\n\nFRESH WATER PENETRATES MORE AGAINST SALT WATER THAN SALT WATER\nAGAINST FRESH WATER.\n\nThat fresh water penetrates more against salt water, than salt water\nagainst fresh is proved by a thin cloth dry and old, hanging with\nthe two opposite ends equally low in the two different waters, the\nsurfaces of which are at an equal level; and it will then be seen\nhow much higher the fresh water will rise in this piece of linen\nthan the salt; by so much is the fresh lighter than the salt.\n\nOn the formation of Gulfs (950. 951).\n\n950.\n\nAll inland seas and the gulfs of those seas, are made by rivers\nwhich flow into the sea.\n\n951.\n\nHERE THE REASON IS GIVEN OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE WATERS IN\nTHE ABOVE MENTIONED PLACE.\n\nAll the lakes and all the gulfs of the sea and all inland seas are\ndue to rivers which distribute their waters into them, and from\nimpediments in their downfall into the Mediterranean --which divides\nAfrica from Europe and Europe from Asia by means of the Nile and the\nDon which pour their waters into it.
