Cecilia graciously lent the picture--now presumably\nlost--adding her regret that it no longer resembled her.\n\n\n\nLEONARDO LEAVES MILAN\n\nAmong the last of Leonardo da Vinci's works in Milan towards the end\nof 1499 was, probably, the superb cartoon of \"The Virgin and Child\nwith St. Anne and St. John,\" now at Burlington House. Though little\nknown to the general public, this large drawing on _carton_, or\nstiff paper, is one of the greatest of London's treasures, as it\nreveals the sweeping line of Leonardo's powerful draughtsmanship. It\nwas in the Pompeo Leoni, Arconati, Casnedi, and Udney Collections\nbefore passing to the Royal Academy.\n\nIn 1499 the stormy times in Milan foreboded the end of Ludovico's\nreign. In April of that year we read of his giving a vineyard to\nLeonardo; in September Ludovico had to leave Milan for the Tyrol to\nraise an army, and on the 14th of the same month the city was sold by\nBernardino di Corte to the French, who occupied it from 1500 to 1512.\nLudovico may well have had in mind the figure of the traitor in the\n\"Last Supper\" when he declared that \"Since the days of Judas Iscariot\nthere has never been so black a traitor as Bernardino di Corte.\" On\nOctober 6th Louis XII. entered the city. Before the end of the year\nLeonardo, realising the necessity for his speedy departure, sent six\nhundred gold florins by letter of exchange to Florence to be placed\nto his credit with the hospital of S. Maria Nuova.\n\nIn the following year, Ludovico having been defeated at Novara,\nLeonardo was a homeless wanderer. He left Milan for Mantua, where he\ndrew a portrait in chalk of Isabella d'Este, which is now in the\nLouvre. Leonardo eventually arrived in Florence about Easter 1500.\nAfter apparently working there in 1501 on a second Cartoon, similar in\nmost respects to the one he had executed in Milan two years earlier,\nhe travelled in Umbria, visiting Orvieto, Pesaro, Rimini, and other\ntowns, acting as engineer and architect to Cesare Borgia, for whom he\nplanned a navigable canal between Cesena and Porto Cese-natico.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.-PORTRAIT (PRESUMED) OF LUCREZIA CRIVELLI\n\nIn the Louvre. No. 1600 [483]. 2 ft by I ft 5 ins. (0.62 x 0.44)\n\nThis picture, although officially attributed to Leonardo, is probably\nnot by him, and almost certainly does not represent Lucrezia Crivelli.\nIt was once known as a \"Portrait of a Lady\" and is still occasionally\nmiscalled \"La Belle Feronniere.\"]\n\n\n\nMONA LISA\n\nEarly in 1503 he was back again in Florence, and set to work in\nearnest on the \"Portrait of Mona Lisa\" (Plate I.), now in the Louvre\n(No. 1601). Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini was the daughter\nof Antonio Gherardini. In 1495 she married Francesco di Bartolommeo de\nZenobi del Giocondo. It is from the surname of her husband that she\nderives the name of \"La Joconde,\" by which her portrait is officially\nknown in the Louvre. Vasari is probably inaccurate in saying that\nLeonardo \"loitered over it for four years, and finally left it\nunfinished.\" He may have begun it in the spring of 1501 and, probably\nowing to having taken service under Cesare Borgia in the following\nyear, put it on one side, ultimately completing it after working on\nthe \"Battle of Anghiari\" in 1504. Vasari's eulogy of this portrait may\nwith advantage be quoted: \"Whoever shall desire to see how far art can\nimitate nature may do so to perfection in this head, wherein every\npeculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost subtlety of the\npencil has been faithfully reproduced. The eyes have the lustrous\nbrightness and moisture which is seen in life, and around them are\nthose pale, red, and slightly livid circles, also proper to nature.\nThe nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils, might be\neasily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, has\nthe lips uniting the rose-tints of their colour with those of the\nface, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek does\nnot appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood. He who looks\nearnestly at the pit of the throat cannot but believe that he sees the\nbeating of the pulses. Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while\nLeonardo was painting her portrait, he took the precaution of keeping\nsome one constantly near her to sing or play on instruments, or to\njest and otherwise amuse her.\"\n\nLeonardo painted this picture in the full maturity of his talent, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
