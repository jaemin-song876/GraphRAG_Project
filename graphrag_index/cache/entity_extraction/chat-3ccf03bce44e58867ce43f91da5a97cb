An arch of a\nvery large curve is weak in itself, and stronger if it be charged,\nand will do little harm to its abutments, and its places of giving\nway are _o p_.\n\n[Footnote: Inside the large figure on the righi is the note: _Da\npesare la forza dell' archo_.]\n\n781.\n\nON THE REMEDY FOR EARTHQUAKES.\n\nThe arch which throws its pressure perpendicularly on the abutments\nwill fulfil its function whatever be its direction, upside down,\nsideways or upright.\n\nThe arch will not break if the chord of the outer arch does not\ntouch the inner arch. This is manifest by experience, because\nwhenever the chord _a o n_ of the outer arch _n r a_ approaches the\ninner arch _x b y_ the arch will be weak, and it will be weaker in\nproportion as the inner arch passes beyond that chord. When an arch\nis loaded only on one side the thrust will press on the top of the\nother side and be transmitted to the spring of the arch on that\nside; and it will break at a point half way between its two\nextremes, where it is farthest from the chord.\n\n782.\n\nA continuous body which has been forcibly bent into an arch, thrusts\nin the direction of the straight line, which it tends to recover.\n\n783.\n\nIn an arch judiciously weighted the thrust is oblique, so that the\ntriangle _c n b_ has no weight upon it.\n\n784.\n\nI here ask what weight will be needed to counterpoise and resist the\ntendency of each of these arches to give way?\n\n[Footnote: The two lower sketches are taken from the MS. S. K. M.\nIII, 10a; they have there no explanatory text.]\n\n785.\n\nON THE STRENGTH OF THE ARCH IN ARCHITECTURE.\n\nThe stability of the arch built by an architect resides in the tie\nand in the flanks.\n\nON THE POSITION OF THE TIE IN THE ABOVE NAMED ARCH.\n\nThe position of the tie is of the same importance at the beginning\nof the arch and at the top of the perpendicular pier on which it\nrests. This is proved by the 2nd \"of supports\" which says: that part\nof a support has least resistance which is farthest from its solid\nattachment; hence, as the top of the pier is farthest from the\nmiddle of its true foundation and the same being the case at the\nopposite extremities of the arch which are the points farthest from\nthe middle, which is really its [upper] attachment, we have\nconcluded that the tie _a b_ requires to be in such a position as\nthat its opposite ends are between the four above-mentioned\nextremes.\n\nThe adversary says that this arch must be more than half a circle,\nand that then it will not need a tie, because then the ends will not\nthrust outwards but inwards, as is seen in the excess at _a c_, _b\nd_. To this it must be answered that this would be a very poor\ndevice, for three reasons. The first refers to the strength of the\narch, since it is proved that the circular parallel being composed\nof two semicircles will only break where these semicircles cross\neach other, as is seen in the figure _n m;_ besides this it follows\nthat there is a wider space between the extremes of the semicircle\nthan between the plane of the walls; the third reason is that the\nweight placed to counterbalance the strength of the arch diminishes\nin proportion as the piers of the arch are wider than the space\nbetween the piers. Fourthly in proportion as the parts at _c a b d_\nturn outwards, the piers are weaker to support the arch above them.\nThe 5th is that all the material and weight of the arch which are in\nexcess of the semicircle are useless and indeed mischievous; and\nhere it is to be noted that the weight placed above the arch will be\nmore likely to break the arch at _a b_, where the curve of the\nexcess begins that is added to the semicircle, than if the pier were\nstraight up to its junction with the semicircle [spring of the\narch].\n\nAN ARCH LOADED OVER THE CROWN WILL GIVE WAY AT THE LEFT HAND AND\nRIGHT HAND QUARTERS.\n\nThis is proved by the 7th of this which says: The opposite ends of\nthe support are equally pressed upon by the weight suspended to\nthem; hence the weight shown at _f_ is felt at _b c_, that is half\nat each extremity; and by the third which says: in a support of\nequal strength [throughout] that portion will give way soonest which\nis farthest from its attachment; whence it follows that _d_ being\nequally distant from _f, e_ .....\n\nIf the centering of the arch does not settle as the arch settles,\nthe mortar, as it dries, will shrink and detach itself from the\nbricks between which it was laid to keep them together; and as it\nthus leaves them disjoined the vault will remain loosely built, and\nthe rains will soon destroy it.\n\n786.\n\nON THE STRENGTH AND NATURE OF ARCHES, AND WHERE THEY ARE STRONG OR\nWEAK; AND THE SAME AS TO COLUMNS.\n\nThat part of the arch which is nearer to the horizontal offers least\nresistance to the weight placed on it.\n\nWhen the triangle _a z n_, by settling, drives backwards the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
