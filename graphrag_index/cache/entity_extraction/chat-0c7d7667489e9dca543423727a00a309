I shall not here enter into any\ndiscussion of this suggestion; but as a justification for\nintroducing the drawing in this place, I may point out that some of\nthe figures illustrate this passage as perfectly as though they had\nbeen drawn for that express purpose. I have discussed the\nprobability of a connection between this sketch and the picture of\nthe Last Supper on p. 335. The original drawing is 27 3/4\ncentimetres wide by 21 high.--The drawing in silver point on reddish\npaper given on Pl. LII. No. 1--the original at Windsor Castle--may\nalso serve to illustrate the subject of appropriate gestures,\ntreated in Nos. 593 and 594.]\n\n595.\n\nOF THE DISPOSITION OF LIMBS.\n\nAs regards the disposition of limbs in movement you will have to\nconsider that when you wish to represent a man who, by some chance,\nhas to turn backwards or to one side, you must not make him move his\nfeet and all his limbs towards the side to which he turns his head.\nRather must you make the action proceed by degrees and through the\ndifferent joints; that is, those of the foot, the knee and the hip\nand the neck. And if you set him on the right leg, you must make the\nleft knee bend inwards, and let his foot be slightly raised on the\noutside, and the left shoulder be somewhat lower than the right,\nwhile the nape of the neck is in a line directly over the outer\nancle of the left foot. And the left shoulder will be in a\nperpendicular line above the toes of the right foot. And always set\nyour figures so that the side to which the head turns is not the\nside to which the breast faces, since nature for our convenience has\nmade us with a neck which bends with ease in many directions, the\neye wishing to turn to various points, the different joints. And if\nat any time you make a man sitting with his arms at work on\nsomething which is sideways to him, make the upper part of his body\nturn upon the hips.\n\n[Footnote: Compare Pl. VII, No. 5. The original drawing at Windsor\nCastle is numbered 104.]\n\n596.\n\nWhen you draw the nude always sketch the whole figure and then\nfinish those limbs which seem to you the best, but make them act\nwith the other limbs; otherwise you will get a habit of never\nputting the limbs well together on the body.\n\nNever make the head turn the same way as the torso, nor the arm and\nleg move together on the same side. And if the face is turned to the\nright shoulder, make all the parts lower on the left side than on\nthe right; and when you turn the body with the breast outwards, if\nthe head turns to the left side make the parts on the right side\nhigher than those on the left.\n\n[Footnote: In the original MS. a much defaced sketch is to be seen\nby the side of the second part of this chapter; its faded condition\nhas rendered reproduction impossible. In M. RAVAISSON'S facsimile\nthe outlines of the head have probably been touched up. This passage\nhowever is fitly illustrated by the drawings on Pl. XXI.]\n\n597.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nOf the nature of movements in man. Do not repeat the same gestures\nin the limbs of men unless you are compelled by the necessity of\ntheir action, as is shown in _a b_.\n\n[Footnote: See Pl. V, where part of the text is also reproduced. The\neffaced figure to the extreme left has evidently been cancelled by\nLeonardo himself as unsatisfactory.]\n\n598.\n\nThe motions of men must be such as suggest their dignity or their\nbaseness.\n\n599.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nMake your work carry out your purpose and meaning. That is when you\ndraw a figure consider well who it is and what you wish it to be\ndoing.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nWith regard to any action which you give in a picture to an old man\nor to a young one, you must make it more energetic in the young man\nin proportion as he is stronger than the old one; and in the same\nway with a young man and an infant.\n\n600.\n\nOF SETTING ON THE LIMBS.\n\nThe limbs which are used for labour must be muscular and those which\nare not much used you must make without muscles and softly rounded.\n\nOF THE ACTION OF THE FIGURES.\n\nRepresent your figures in such action as may be fitted to express\nwhat purpose is in the mind of each; otherwise your art will not be\nadmirable.\n\nV.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR COMPOSITIONS.\n\nOf painting battle pieces (601-603).\n\n601.\n\nOF THE WAY OF REPRESENTING A BATTLE.\n\nFirst you must represent the smoke of artillery mingling in the air\nwith the dust and tossed up by the movement of horses and the\ncombatants. And this mixture you must express thus: The dust, being\na thing of earth, has weight; and although from its fineness it is\neasily tossed up and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
