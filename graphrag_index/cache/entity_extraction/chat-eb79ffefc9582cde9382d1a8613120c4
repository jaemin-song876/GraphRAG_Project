And this cloud attracted to it\nall the little clouds that were near while the large one did not\nmove from its place; thus it retained on its summit the reflection\nof the sunlight till an hour and a half after sunset, so immensely\nlarge was it; and about two hours after sunset such a violent wind\narose, that it was really tremendous and unheard of.\n\n[Footnote: _di arie_ is wanting in the original but may safely be\ninserted in the context, as the formation of clouds is under\ndiscussion before this text.]\n\n1022.\n\nOn the 10th day of December at 9 o'clock a. m. fire was set to the\nplace.\n\nOn the l8th day of December 1511 at 9 o'clock a. m. this second fire\nwas kindled by the Swiss at Milan at the place called DCXC.\n[Footnote: With these two texts, (l. 1--2 and l. 3--5 are in the\noriginal side by side) there are sketches of smoke wreaths in red\nchalk.]\n\nNote on Pavia.\n\n1023.\n\nThe chimneys of the castle of Pavia have 6 rows of openings and from\neach to the other is one braccio.\n\n[Footnote: Other notes relating to Pavia occur on p. 43 and p. 53\n(Pl. XCVIII, No. 3). Compare No. 1448, 26.]\n\nNotes on the Sforzesca near Vigevano (1024-1028).\n\n1024.\n\nOn the 2nd day of February 1494. At Sforzesca I drew twenty five\nsteps, 2/3 braccia to each, and 8 braccia wide.\n\n[Footnote: See Pl. CX, No. 2. The rest of the notes on this page\nrefer to the motion of water. On the lower sketch we read: 4 _br._\n(four braccia) and _giara_ (for _ghiaja_, sand, gravel).]\n\n1025.\n\nThe vineyards of Vigevano on the 20th day of March 1494.\n\n[Footnote: On one side there is an effaced sketch in red chalk.]\n\n1026.\n\nTo lock up a butteris at Vigevano.\n\n1027.\n\nAgain if the lowest part of the bank which lies across the current\nof the waters is made in deep and wide steps, after the manner of\nstairs, the waters which, in their course usually fall\nperpendicularly from the top of such a place to the bottom, and wear\naway the foundations of this bank can no longer descend with a blow\nof too great a force; and I find the example of this in the stairs\ndown which the water falls in the fields at Sforzesca at Vigevano\nover which the running water falls for a height of 50 braccia.\n\n1028.\n\nStair of Vigevano below La Sforzesca, 130 steps, 1/4 braccio high\nand 1/2 braccio wide, down which the water falls, so as not to wear\naway anything at the end of its fall; by these steps so much soil\nhas come down that it has dried up a pool; that is to say it has\nfilled it up and a pool of great depth has been turned into meadows.\n\nNotes on the North Italian lake. (1029-1033)\n\n1029.\n\nIn many places there are streams of water which swell for six hours\nand ebb for six hours; and I, for my part, have seen one above the\nlake of Como called Fonte Pliniana, which increases and ebbs, as I\nhave said, in such a way as to turn the stones of two mills; and\nwhen it fails it falls so low that it is like looking at water in a\ndeep pit.\n\n[Footnote: The fountain is known by this name to this day: it is\nnear Torno, on the Eastern shore of Como. The waters still rise and\nfall with the flow and ebb of the tide as Pliny described it (Epist.\nIV, 30; Hist. Nat. II, 206).]\n\n1030.\n\nLAKE OF COMO. VALLEY OF CHIAVENNA.\n\nAbove the lake of Como towards Germany is the valley of Chiavenna\nwhere the river Mera flows into this lake. Here are barren and very\nhigh mountains, with huge rocks. Among these mountains are to be\nfound the water-birds called gulls. Here grow fir trees, larches and\npines. Deer, wildgoats, chamois, and terrible bears. It is\nimpossible to climb them without using hands and feet. The peasants\ngo there at the time of the snows with great snares to make the\nbears fall down these rocks. These mountains which very closely\napproach each other are parted by the river. They are to the right\nand left for the distance of 20 miles throughout of the same nature.\n>From mile to mile there are good inns.
