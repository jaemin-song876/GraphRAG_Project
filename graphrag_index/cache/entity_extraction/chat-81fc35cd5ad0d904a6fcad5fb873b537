But none of these editions were\nderived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been\nlost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo's text had been more\nor less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on\nthe whole the best copy of Leonardo's essays and precepts on\nPainting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,\nfirst by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,\nthis ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much\nfor which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some\nportions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of\nthe human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain\npassages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified from any\noriginal Manuscript extant. These copies, at any rate neither give\nus the original order of the texts, as written by Leonardo, nor do\nthey afford any substitute, by connecting them on a rational scheme;\nindeed, in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than\nsatisfactory reading. The fault, no doubt, rests with the compiler\nof the Vatican copy, which would seem to be the source whence all\nthe published and extensively known texts were derived; for, instead\nof arranging the passages himself, he was satisfied with recording a\nsuggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct\nparts, without attempting to carry out his scheme. Under the\nmistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that, not of\nthe compiler, but of Leonardo himself, the various editors, down to\nthe present day, have very injudiciously continued to adopt this\norder--or rather disorder.\n\nI, like other enquirers, had given up the original Manuscript of the\nTrattato della Pittura for lost, till, in the beginning of 1880, I\nwas enabled, by the liberality of Lord Ashburnham, to inspect his\nManuscripts, and was so happy as to discover among them the original\ntext of the best-known portion of the Trattato in his magnificent\nlibrary at Ashburnham Place. Though this discovery was of a fragment\nonly--but a considerable fragment--inciting me to further search,\nit gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first\norigin of all the known copies of the Trattato. The extensive\nresearches I was subsequently enabled to prosecute, and the results\nof which are combined in this work, were only rendered possible by\nthe unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the\nManuscripts by Leonardo dispersed throughout Europe, and to\nreproduce the highly important original sketches they contain, by\nthe process of \"photogravure\". Her Majesty the Queen graciously\naccorded me special permission to copy for publication the\nManuscripts at the Royal Library at Windsor. The Commission Centrale\nAdministrative de l'Institut de France, Paris, gave me, in the most\nliberal manner, in answer to an application from Sir Frederic\nLeighton, P. R. A., Corresponding member of the Institut, free\npermission to work for several months in their private collection at\ndeciphering the Manuscripts preserved there. The same favour which\nLord Ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the\nEarl of Leicester, the Marchese Trivulsi, and the Curators of the\nAmbrosian Library at Milan, by the Conte Manzoni at Rome and by\nother private owners of Manuscripts of Leonardo's; as also by the\nDirectors of the Louvre at Paris; the Accademia at Venice; the\nUffizi at Florence; the Royal Library at Turin; and the British\nMuseum, and the South Kensington Museum. I am also greatly indebted\nto the Librarians of these various collections for much assistance\nin my labours; and more particularly to Monsieur Louis Lalanne, of\nthe Institut de France, the Abbate Ceriani, of the Ambrosian\nLibrary, Mr. Maude Thompson, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British\nMuseum, Mr. Holmes, the Queens Librarian at Windsor, the Revd Vere\nBayne, Librarian of Christ Church College at Oxford, and the Revd A.\nNapier, Librarian to the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall.\n\nIn correcting the Italian text for the press, I have had the\nadvantage of valuable advice from the Commendatore Giov. Morelli,\nSenatore del Regno, and from Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, of Milan. The\ntranslation, under many difficulties, of the Italian text into\nEnglish, is mainly due to Mrs. R. C. Bell; while the rendering of\nseveral of the most puzzling and important passages, particularly in\nthe second half of Vol. I, I owe to the indefatigable interest taken\nin this work by Mr. E. J. Poynter R. A. Finally I must express my\nthanks to Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, who has most kindly\nassisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets.\n\nThe notes and dissertations on the texts on Architecture in Vol. II\nI owe to my friend Baron Henri de Geymuller, of Paris.\n\nI may further mention with regard to the illustrations, that the\nnegatives for the production of the \"photo-gravures\" by Monsieur\nDujardin of Paris were all taken direct from the originals.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here\nreproduced in facsimile have never been\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
