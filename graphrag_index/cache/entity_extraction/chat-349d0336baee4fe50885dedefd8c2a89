Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

And in cases\nwhere you lack experience do not shrink from drawing them from\nnature. But, to carry out my promise above [in the title]--I say\nthat when you paint you should have a flat mirror and often look at\nyour work as reflected in it, when you will see it reversed, and it\nwill appear to you like some other painter's work, so you will be\nbetter able to judge of its faults than in any other way. Again, it\nis well that you should often leave off work and take a little\nrelaxation, because, when you come back to it you are a better\njudge; for sitting too close at work may greatly deceive you. Again,\nit is good to retire to a distance because the work looks smaller\nand your eye takes in more of it at a glance and sees more easily\nthe discords or disproportion in the limbs and colours of the\nobjects.\n\nOn the management of works (531. 532).\n\n531.\n\nOF A METHOD OF LEARNING WELL BY HEART.\n\nWhen you want to know a thing you have studied in your memory\nproceed in this way: When you have drawn the same thing so many\ntimes that you think you know it by heart, test it by drawing it\nwithout the model; but have the model traced on flat thin glass and\nlay this on the drawing you have made without the model, and note\ncarefully where the tracing does not coincide with your drawing, and\nwhere you find you have gone wrong; and bear in mind not to repeat\nthe same mistakes. Then return to the model, and draw the part in\nwhich you were wrong again and again till you have it well in your\nmind. If you have no flat glass for tracing on, take some very thin\nkidts-kin parchment, well oiled and dried. And when you have used it\nfor one drawing you can wash it clean with a sponge and make a\nsecond.\n\n532.\n\nTHAT A PAINTER OUGHT TO BE CURIOUS TO HEAR THE OPINIONS OF EVERY ONE\nON HIS WORK.\n\nCertainly while a man is painting he ought not to shrink from\nhearing every opinion. For we know very well that a man, though he\nmay not be a painter, is familiar with the forms of other men and\nvery capable of judging whether they are hump backed, or have one\nshoulder higher or lower than the other, or too big a mouth or nose,\nand other defects; and, as we know that men are competent to judge\nof the works of nature, how much more ought we to admit that they\ncan judge of our errors; since you know how much a man may be\ndeceived in his own work. And if you are not conscious of this in\nyourself study it in others and profit by their faults. Therefore be\ncurious to hear with patience the opinions of others, consider and\nweigh well whether those who find fault have ground or not for\nblame, and, if so amend; but, if not make as though you had not\nheard, or if he should be a man you esteem show him by argument the\ncause of his mistake.\n\nOn the limitations of painting (533-535)\n\n533.\n\nHOW IN SMALL OBJECTS ERRORS ARE LESS EVIDENT THAN IN LARGE ONES.\n\nIn objects of minute size the extent of error is not so perceptible\nas in large ones; and the reason is that if this small object is a\nrepresentation of a man or of some other animal, from the immense\ndiminution the details cannot be worked out by the artist with the\nfinish that is requisite. Hence it is not actually complete; and,\nnot being complete, its faults cannot be determined. For instance:\nLook at a man at a distance of 300 braccia and judge attentively\nwhether he be handsome or ugly, or very remarkable or of ordinary\nappearance. You will find that with the utmost effort you cannot\npersuade yourself to decide. And the reason is that at such a\ndistance the man is so much diminished that the character of the\ndetails cannot be determined. And if you wish to see how much this\nman is diminished [by distance] hold one of your fingers at a span's\ndistance from your eye, and raise or lower it till the top joint\ntouches the feet of the figure you are looking at, and you will see\nan incredible reduction. For this reason we often doubt as to the\nperson of a friend at a distance.\n\n534.\n\nWHY A PAINTING CAN NEVER APPEAR DETACHED AS NATURAL OBJECTS DO.\n\nPainters often fall into despair of imitating nature when they see\ntheir pictures fail in that relief and vividness which objects have\nthat are seen in a mirror; while they allege that they have colours\nwhich for brightness or depth far exceed the strength of light and\nshade in the reflections in the mirror, thus displaying their own\nignorance rather than the real cause, because they do not know it.\nIt is impossible that painted objects should appear in such relief\nas to resemble those reflected in the mirror, although both are seen\non a flat surface, unless they are seen with only one eye; and the\nreason is that two eyes see one object behind another as _a_ and _b_\nsee _m_ and _n_. _m_ cannot exactly occupy [the space of] _n_\nbecause the base of the visual lines is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
