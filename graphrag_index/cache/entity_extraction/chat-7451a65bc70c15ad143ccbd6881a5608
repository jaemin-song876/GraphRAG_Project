How false the opinion is of those who say that\nthis happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its\nposition.\n\nHow the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down\nin seeing.\n\n[Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is\nfully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the\noriginal; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them\nhere.]\n\nDemostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane\n(83-85).\n\n83.\n\nOF THE PLANE OF GLASS.\n\nPerspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a\nplane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the\nobjects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in\npyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected\non the glass plane.\n\n84.\n\nPictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,\nlook of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the\napex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the\nsame point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is\nthe base made by the painter's point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which\nis the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and\nrefracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by\nexperiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the\npainter's plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and\nthe same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.\n\n85.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of\nthe central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this\nplane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass\nwould, through which you might see the various objects and draw them\non it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the\noriginals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the\neye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will\nshow, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects\ncausing them.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nAll those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by\nperpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width\nthe more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and\nthe more the eye is above them the more will their real width be\nseen.\n\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see\nof it.\n\nThe angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)\n\n86.\n\nA simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye\nwithout any other medium.\n\nThe object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than\nanother of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing\nthe spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and\nthe. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is\nquite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French\ntranslation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est\nclair que c'est par erreur que Leonard a \u00e8crit_ per esser visino _au\nlieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.\n38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_\nthe space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space\n_v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place\nwhere you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason\nof the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this\nproceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the\nplane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you\nwould have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole\nwhich must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of\nat least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_\nbeing always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects\nin a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.\n\n87.\n\nHow every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish\nthrough infinity.\n\nThe images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be\ninfinitely diminished.\n\n88.\n\nObjects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by\ndifferent pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the\nobject is farther off.\n\n89.\n\nPerspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite\npyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as\ndistant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and\nthe apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]\nuniverse, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of\nthe eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small\nopening; for the more remote the objects are\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
