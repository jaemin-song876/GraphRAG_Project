He who looks\nearnestly at the pit of the throat cannot but believe that he sees the\nbeating of the pulses. Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and while\nLeonardo was painting her portrait, he took the precaution of keeping\nsome one constantly near her to sing or play on instruments, or to\njest and otherwise amuse her.\"\n\nLeonardo painted this picture in the full maturity of his talent, and,\nalthough it is now little more than a monochrome owing to the free and\nmerciless restoration to which it has been at times subjected, it must\nhave created a wonderful impression on those who saw it in the early\nyears of the sixteenth century. It is difficult for the unpractised\neye to-day to form any idea of its original beauty. Leonardo has here\npainted this worldly-minded woman--her portrait is much more famous\nthan she herself ever was--with a marvellous charm and suavity, a\nfinesse of expression never reached before and hardly ever equalled\nsince. Contrast the head of the Christ at Milan, Leonardo's conception\nof divinity expressed in perfect humanity, with the subtle and\nsphinx-like smile of this languorous creature.\n\nThe landscape background, against which Mona Lisa is posed, recalls\nthe severe, rather than exuberant, landscape and the dim vistas of\nmountain ranges seen in the neighbourhood of his own birthplace. The\nportrait was bought during the reign of Francis I. for a sum which is\nto-day equal to about L1800. Leonardo, by the way, does not seem to\nhave been really affected by any individual affection for any woman,\nand, like Michelangelo and Raphael, never married.\n\nIn January 4, 1504, Leonardo was one of the members of the Committee\nof Artists summoned to advise the Signoria as to the most suitable\nsite for the erection of Michelangelo's statue of \"David,\" which had\nrecently been completed.\n\n\n\n\nBATTLE OF ANGHIARI\n\nIn the following May he was commissioned by the Signoria to decorate\none of the walls of the Council Hall of the Palazzo Vecchio. The\nsubject he selected was the \"Battle of Anghiari.\" Although he\ncompleted the cartoon, the only part of the composition which he\neventually executed in colour was an incident in the foreground\nwhich dealt with the \"Battle of the Standard.\" One of the many\nsupposed copies of a study of this mural painting now hangs on the\nsouth-east staircase in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It depicts the\nFlorentines under Cardinal Ludovico Mezzarota Scarampo fighting\nagainst the Milanese under Niccolo Piccinino, the General of Filippo\nMaria Visconti, on June 29, 1440.\n\n\n\nAGAIN IN MILAN\n\nLeonardo was back in Milan in May 1506 in the service of the French\nKing, for whom he executed, apparently with the help of assistants,\n\"the Madonna, the Infant Christ, and Saint Anne\" (Plate VIII.). The\ncomposition of this oil-painting seems to have been built up on the\nsecond cartoon, which he had made some eight years earlier, and which\nwas apparently taken to France in 1516 and ultimately lost.\n\n\n\nIN ROME\n\nFrom 1513-1515 he was in Rome, where Giovanni de' Medici had been\nelected Pope under the title of Leo X. He did not, however, work for\nthe Pope, although he resided in the Vatican, his time being occupied\nin studying acoustics, anatomy, optics, geology, minerals,\nengineering, and geometry!\n\n\n\nIN FRANCE\n\nAt last in 1516, three years before his death, Leonardo left his\nnative land for France, where he received from Francis I. a princely\nincome. His powers, however, had already begun to fail, and he\nproduced very little in the country of his adoption. It is,\nnevertheless, only in the Louvre that his achievements as a painter\ncan to-day be adequately studied.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.-MADONNA, INFANT CHRIST, AND ST. ANNE\n\nIn the Louvre.
