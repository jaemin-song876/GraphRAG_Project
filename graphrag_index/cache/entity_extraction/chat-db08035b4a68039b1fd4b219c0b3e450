These are placed at the\nintersection of a system of semicircles, of which the sixteen\ncolumns on the sides of the octagon are the centres.\n\nb) The preceding diagram is completed and becomes more monumental in\nstyle in the sketch next to it (MS. B, 35a, see p. 45 Fig. 1). An\nouter aisle is added by circles, having for radius the distance\nbetween the columns in the middle sides of the octagon.\n\nc) (MS. B. 96b, see p. 45 Fig. 2). Octagon with an aisle round it;\nthe angles of both are formed by columns. The outer sides are formed\nby 8 niches forming chapels. The exterior is likewise octagonal,\nwith the angles corresponding to the centre of each of the interior\nchapels.\n\nPl. XCII, No. 2 (MS. B. 96b). Detail and modification of the\npreceding plan--half columns against piers--an arrangement by which\nthe chapels of the aisle have the same width of opening as the inner\narches between the half columns. Underneath this sketch the\nfollowing note occurs:_ questo vole - avere 12 facce - co 12\ntabernaculi - come - _a_ - _b_. _(This will have twelve sides with\ntwelve tabernacles as_ a b._) In the remaining sketches of this\nclass the octagon is not formed by columns at the angles.\n\nThe simplest type shows a niche in the middle of each side and is\nrepeated on several sheets, viz: MS. B 3; MS. C.A. 354b (see Pl.\nLXXXIV, No. 11) and MS. Ash II 6b; (see Pl. LXXXV, No. 9 and the\nelevations No. 8; Pl. XCII, No. 3; MS. B. 4b [not reproduced here]\nand Pl. LXXXIV, No. 2)._\n\n_Pl.

Underneath there is the remark:_\n\"quest'e come le 8 cappele ano a essere facte\" _(this is how the\neight chapels are to be executed).\n\nc) Pl. LXXXVIII, No. 5. Elevation to the plans on the same sheet, it\nis accompanied by the note:_ \"ciasscuno de' 9 tiburi no'uole -\npassare l'alteza - di - 2 - quadri\" _(neither of the 9 domes must\nexceed the height of two squares).\n\nd) Pl. LXXXVIII, No. 1. Inside of the same octagon. MS. B, 30a, and\n34b; these are three repetitions of parts of the same plan with very\nslight variations.\n\nD. by a circular chapel:\n\nMS. B, 18a (see Fig. 1 on page 47) gives the plan of this\narrangement in which the exterior is square on the ground floor with\nonly four of the chapels projecting, as is explained in the next\nsketch.\n\nPl. LXXXIX, MS. B, 17b. Elevation to the preceding plan sketched on\nthe opposite side of the sheet, and also marked A. It is accompanied\nby the following remark, indicating the theoretical character of\nthese studies:_ questo - edifitio - anchora - starebbe - bene\naffarlo dalla linja - _a_ - _b_ - _c_ - _d_ - insu. _(\"This edifice\nwould also produce a good effect if only the part above the lines_ a\nb, c d, _were executed\").\n\nPl. LXXXIV, No. 11. The exterior has the form of an octagon, but the\nchapels project partly beyond it. On the left side of the sketch\nthey appear larger than on the right side.\n\nPl. XC, No. 1, (MS.
