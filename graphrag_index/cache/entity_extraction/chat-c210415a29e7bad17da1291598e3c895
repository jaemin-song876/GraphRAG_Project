The question asked in No. 486 remains unanswered by him\nand it seems to me very doubtful whether the opinion stated in No.\n487 is to be regarded as a reply to it. This opinion stands in the\nMS. in a connection--as will be explained later on--which seems to\nrequire us to limit its application to a single special case. At any\nrate we may suspect that when Leonardo put the question, he felt\nsome hesitation as to the answer. Among his very numerous drawings I\nhave not been able to find a single study from the antique, though a\ndrawing in black chalk, at Windsor, of a man on horseback (PI.\nLXXIII) may perhaps be a reminiscence of the statue of Marcus\nAurelius at Rome. It seems to me that the drapery in a pen and ink\ndrawing of a bust, also at Windsor, has been borrowed from an\nantique model (Pl. XXX). G. G. Rossi has, I believe, correctly\ninterpreted Leonardo's feeling towards the antique in the following\nnote on this passage in manzi's edition, p. 501: \"Sappiamo dalla\nstoria, che i valorosi artisti Toscani dell'et\u00e0 dell'oro dell'arte\nstudiarono sugli antichi marmi raccolti dal Magnifico LORENZO DE'\nMEDICI. Pare che il Vinci a tali monumenti non si accostasse. Quest'\nuomo sempre riconosce per maestra la natura, e questo principio lo\nstringeva alla sola imitazione d\u00ec essa\"--Compare No. 10, 26--28\nfootnote.]\n\nThe necessity of anatomical knowledge (488. 489).\n\n488.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nIt is indispensable to a Painter who would be thoroughly familiar\nwith the limbs in all the positions and actions of which they are\ncapable, in the nude, to know the anatomy of the sinews, bones,\nmuscles and tendons so that, in their various movements and\nexertions, he may know which nerve or muscle is the cause of each\nmovement and show those only as prominent and thickened, and not the\nothers all over [the limb], as many do who, to seem great\ndraughtsmen, draw their nude figures looking like wood, devoid of\ngrace; so that you would think you were looking at a sack of walnuts\nrather than the human form, or a bundle of radishes rather than the\nmuscles of figures.\n\n489.\n\nHOW IT IS NECESSARY TO A PAINTER THAT HE SHOULD KNOW THE INTRINSIC\nFORMS [STRUCTURE] OF MAN.\n\nThe painter who is familiar with the nature of the sinews, muscles,\nand tendons, will know very well, in giving movement to a limb, how\nmany and which sinews cause it; and which muscle, by swelling,\ncauses the contraction of that sinew; and which sinews, expanded\ninto the thinnest cartilage, surround and support the said muscle.\nThus he will variously and constantly demonstrate the different\nmuscles by means of the various attitudes of his figures, and will\nnot do, as many who, in a variety of movements, still display the\nvery same things [modelling] in the arms, back, breast and legs. And\nthese things are not to be regarded as minor faults.\n\nHow to acquire practice.\n\n490.\n\nOF STUDY AND THE ORDER OF STUDY.\n\nI say that first you ought to learn the limbs and their mechanism,\nand having this knowledge, their actions should come next, according\nto the circumstances in which they occur in man. And thirdly to\ncompose subjects, the studies for which should be taken from natural\nactions and made from time to time, as circumstances allow; and pay\nattention to them in the streets and _piazze_ and fields, and note\nthem down with a brief indication of the forms; [Footnote 5: Lines\n5-7 explained by the lower portion of the sketch No. 1 on Pl. XXXI.]\nthus for a head make an o, and for an arm a straight or a bent line,\nand the same for the legs and the body, [Footnote 7: Lines 5-7\nexplained by the lower portion of the sketch No. 1 on Pl. XXXI.] and\nwhen you return home work out these notes in a complete form. The\nAdversary says that to acquire practice and do a great deal of work\nit is better that the first period of study should be employed in\ndrawing various compositions done on paper or on walls by divers\nmasters, and that in this way practice is rapidly gained, and good\nmethods; to which I reply that the method will be good, if it is\nbased on works of good composition and by skilled masters. But since\nsuch masters are so rare that there are but few of them to be found,\nit is a surer way to go to natural objects, than to those which are\nimitated from nature with great deterioration, and so form bad\nmethods; for he who can go to the fountain does not go to the\nwater-jar.\n\n[Footnote: This passage has been published by Dr. M.
