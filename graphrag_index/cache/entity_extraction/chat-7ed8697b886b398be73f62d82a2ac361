And\nthe shadows will be one darker than the other in proportion as one\nlight is nearer to the said body than the other on the opposite\nside.\n\nA body placed at an equal distance between two lights will cast two\nshadows, one deeper than the other in proportion, as the light which\ncauses it is brighter than the other.\n\n[Footnote: In the MS. the larger diagram is placed above the first\nline; the smaller one between l. 4 & 5.]\n\n181.\n\nA light which is smaller than the body it illuminates produces\nshadows of which the outlines end within [the surface of] the body,\nand not much compound shadow; and falls on less than half of it. A\nlight which is larger than the body it illuminates, falls on more\nthan half of it, and produces much compound shadow.\n\nThe effect of light at different distances.\n\n182.\n\nOF THE SHADOW CAST BY A BODY PLACED BETWEEN 2 EQUAL LIGHTS.\n\nA body placed between 2 equal lights will cast 2 shadows of itself\nin the direction of the lines of the 2 lights; and if you move this\nbody placing it nearer to one of the lights the shadow cast towards\nthe nearer light will be less deep than that which falls towards the\nmore distant one.\n\nFurther complications in the derived shadows (183-187).\n\n183.\n\nThe greatest depth of shadow is in the simple derived shadow because\nit is not lighted by either of the two lights _a b, c d_.\n\nThe next less deep shadow is the derived shadow _e f n_; and in this\nthe shadow is less by half, because it is illuminated by a single\nlight, that is _c d_.\n\nThis is uniform in natural tone because it is lighted throughout by\none only of the two luminous bodies [10]. But it varies with the\nconditions of shadow, inasmuch as the farther it is away from the\nlight the less it is illuminated by it [13].\n\nThe third degree of depth is the middle shadow [Footnote 15: We\ngather from what follows that _q g r_ here means _ombra media_ (the\nmiddle shadow).]. But this is not uniform in natural tone; because\nthe nearer it gets to the simple derived shadow the deeper it is\n[Footnote 18: Compare lines 10-13], and it is the uniformly gradual\ndiminution by increase of distance which is what modifies it\n[Footnote 20: See Footnote 18]: that is to say the depth of a shadow\nincreases in proportion to the distance from the two lights.\n\nThe fourth is the shadow _k r s_ and this is all the darker in\nnatural tone in proportion as it is nearer to _k s_, because it gets\nless of the light _a o_, but by the accident [of distance] it is\nrendered less deep, because it is nearer to the light _c d_, and\nthus is always exposed to both lights.\n\nThe fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because\nit is always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole\nor part of the other; and it is less deep in proportion as it is\nnearer to the two lights, and in proportion as it is turned towards\nthe outer side _x t_; because it is more exposed to the second light\n_a b_.\n\n[Footnote: The diagram to this section is given on Pl. V. To the\nleft is the facsimile of the beginning of the text belonging to it.]\n\n184.\n\nOF SIMPLE SHADOWS.\n\nWhy, at the intersections _a_, _b_ of the two compound shadows _e f_\nand _m e_, is a simple shadow pfoduced as at _e h_ and _m g_, while\nno such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections _c\nd_ made by the very same compound shadows?\n\nANSWER.\n\nCompound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows\nare simply darkness. Hence, of the two lights _n_ and _o_, one falls\non the compound shadow from one side, and the other on the compound\nshadow from the other side, but where they intersect no light falls,\nas at _a b_; therefore it is a simple shadow. Where there is a\ncompound shadow one light or the other falls; and here a difficulty\narises for my adversary since he says that, where the compound\nshadows intersect, both the lights which produce the shadows must of\nnecessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised;\ninasmuch as the two lights do not fall there, we say that the shadow\nis a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls, we say\nthe shadow is compound, and where both the lights fall the shadow is\nneutralised; for where both lights fall, no shadow of any kind is\nproduced, but only a light background limiting the shadow. Here I\nshall say that what my adversary said was true: but he only mentions\nsuch truths as are in his favour; and if we go on to the rest he\nmust conclude that my proposition is true. And that is: That if both\nlights fell on the point of intersection, the shadows would be\nneutralised.
