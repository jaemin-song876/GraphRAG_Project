CIV.]\n\n771.\n\nThe cracks in walls will never be parallel unless the part of the\nwall that separates from the remainder does not slip down.\n\nWHAT IS THE LAW BY WHICH BUILDINGS HAVE STABILITY.\n\nThe stability of buildings is the result of the contrary law to the\ntwo former cases. That is to say that the walls must be all built up\nequally, and by degrees, to equal heights all round the building,\nand the whole thickness at once, whatever kind of walls they may be.\nAnd although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will\nnot necessarily give way under the added weight day by day and thus,\n[16] although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one, it\nwill not give way under the weight which the latter may acquire from\nday to day. Because if double the amount of it dries in one day, one\nof double the thickness will dry in two days or thereabouts; thus\nthe small addition of weight will be balanced by the smaller\ndifference of time [18].\n\nThe adversary says that _a_ which projects, slips down.\n\nAnd here the adversary says that _r_ slips and not _c_.\n\nHOW TO PROGNOSTICATE THE CAUSES OF CRACKS IN ANY SORT OF WALL.\n\nThe part of the wall which does not slip is that in which the\nobliquity projects and overhangs the portion which has parted from\nit and slipped down.\n\nON THE SITUATION OF FOUNDATIONS AND IN WHAT PLACES THEY ARE A CAUSE\nOF RUIN.\n\nWhen the crevice in the wall is wider at the top than at the bottom,\nit is a manifest sign, that the cause of the fissure in the wall is\nremote from the perpendicular line through the crevice.\n\n[Footnote: Lines 1-5 refer to Pl.

Thus, if\none side of a wall were in contact with a damp slope and the other\nwere in contact with the air, then this latter side would remain of\nthe same size as before; that side which dries in the air will\nshrink or diminish and the side which is kept damp will not dry. And\nthe dry portion will break away readily from the damp portion\nbecause the damp part not shrinking in the same proportion does not\ncohere and follow the movement of the part which dries continuously.\n\nOF ARCHED CRACKS, WIDE AT THE TOP, AND NARROW BELOW.\n\nArched cracks, wide at the top and narrow below are found in\nwalled-up doors, which shrink more in their height than in their\nbreadth, and in proportion as their height is greater than their\nwidth, and as the joints of the mortar are more numerous in the\nheight than in the width.\n\nThe crack diminishes less in _r o_ than in _m n_, in proportion as\nthere is less material between _r_ and _o_ than between _n_ and _m_.\n\nAny crack made in a concave wall is wide below and narrow at the\ntop; and this originates, as is here shown at _b c d_, in the side\nfigure.\n\n1. That which gets wet increases in proportion to the moisture it\nimbibes.\n\n2. And a wet object shrinks, while drying, in proportion to the\namount of moisture which evaporates from it.\n\n[Footnote: The text of this passage is reproduced in facsimile on\nPl. CVI to the left.

The cracks which are in a vertical\ndirection are caused by the joining of new walls, with old walls,\nwhether straight or with indentations fitting on to those of the old\nwall; for, as these indentations cannot bear the too great weight of\nthe wall added on to them, it is inevitable that they should break,\nand give way to the settling of the new wall, which will shrink one\nbraccia in every ten, more or less, according to the greater or\nsmaller quantity of mortar used between the stones of the masonry,\nand whether this mortar\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
