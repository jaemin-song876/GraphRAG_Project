We may therefore regard it as particularly\nfortunate that no fewer than thirteen notes in the master's\nhandwriting can be brought together, which seem to throw light on\nthe mysterious history of this famous work. Until now writers on\nLeonardo were acquainted only with the passages numbered 712, 719,\n720, 722 and 723.\n\nIn arranging these notes on sculpture I have given the precedence to\nthose which treat of the casting of the monument, not merely because\nthey are the fullest, but more especially with a view to\nreconstructing the monument, an achievement which really almost lies\nwithin our reach by combining and comparing the whole of the\nmaterials now brought to light, alike in notes and in sketches.\n\nA good deal of the first two passages, Nos. 710 and 711, which refer\nto this subject seems obscure and incomprehensible; still, they\nsupplement each other and one contributes in no small degree to the\ncomprehension of the other. A very interesting and instructive\ncommentary on these passages may be found in the fourth chapter of\nVasari's Introduzione della Scultura under the title \"Come si fanno\ni modelli per fare di bronzo le figure grandi e picciole, e come le\nforme per buttarle; come si armino di ferri, e come si gettino di\nmetallo,\" &c. Among the drawings of models of the moulds for casting\nwe find only one which seems to represent the horse in the act of\ngalloping--No. 713. All the other designs show the horse as pacing\nquietly and as these studies of the horse are accompanied by copious\nnotes as to the method of casting, the question as to the position\nof the horse in the model finally selected, seems to be decided by\npreponderating evidence. \"Il cavallo dello Sforza\"--C. Boito remarks\nvery appositely in the Saggio on page 26, \"doveva sembrare fratello\nal cavallo del Colleoni. E si direbbe che questo fosse figlio del\ncavallo del Gattamelata, il quale pare figlio di uno dei quattro\ncavalli che stavano forse sull' Arco di Nerone in Roma\" (now at\nVenice). The publication of the Saggio also contains the\nreproduction of a drawing in red chalk, representing a horse walking\nto the left and supported by a scaffolding, given here on Pl. LXXVI,\nNo. 1. It must remain uncertain whether this represents the model as\nit stood during the preparations for casting it, or whether--as\nseems to me highly improbable--this sketch shows the model as it was\nexhibited in 1493 on the Piazza del Castello in Milan under a\ntriumphal arch, on the occasion of the marriage of the Emperor\nMaximilian to Bianca Maria Sforza. The only important point here is\nto prove that strong evidence seems to show that, of the numerous\nstudies for the equestrian statue, only those which represent the\nhorse pacing agree with the schemes of the final plans.\n\nThe second group of preparatory sketches, representing the horse as\ngalloping, must therefore be considered separately, a distinction\nwhich, in recapitulating the history of the origin of the monument\nseems justified by the note given under No. 720.\n\nGaleazza Maria Sforza was assassinated in 1476 before his scheme for\nerecting a monument to his father Francesco Sforza could be carried\ninto effect. In the following year Ludovico il Moro the young\naspirant to the throne was exiled to Pisa, and only returned to\nMilan in 1479 when he was Lord (Governatore) of the State of Milan,\nin 1480 after the minister Cecco Simonetta had been murdered. It may\nhave been soon after this that Ludovico il Moro announced a\ncompetition for an equestrian statue, and it is tolerably certain\nthat Antonio del Pollajuolo took part in it, from this passage in\nVasari's Life of this artist: \"E si trovo, dopo la morte sua, il\ndisegno e modello che a Lodovico Sforza egli aveva fatto per la\nstatua a cavallo di Francesco Sforza, duca di Milano; il quale\ndisegno e nel nostro Libro, in due modi: in uno egli ha sotto\nVerona; nell'altro, egli tutto armato, e sopra un basamento pieno di\nbattaglie, fa saltare il cavallo addosso a un armato; ma la cagione\nperche non mettesse questi disegni in opera, non ho gia potuto\nsapere.\" One of Pollajuolo's drawings, as here described, has lately\nbeen discovered by Senatore Giovanni Morelli in the Munich\nPinacothek. Here the profile of the horseman is a portrait of\nFrancesco Duke of Milan, and under the horse, who is galloping to\nthe left, we see a warrior thrown and lying on the ground; precisely\nthe same idea as we find in some of Leonardo's designs for the\nmonument, as on Pl. LXVI, LXVII, LXVIII, LXIX and LXXII No. 1; and,\nas it is impossible to explain this remarkable coincidence by\nsupposing that either artist borrowed it from the other, we can only\nconclude that in the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
