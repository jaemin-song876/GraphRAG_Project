From all this\nwe may suppose that Leonardo here had in mind either some festive\ndecoration, or perhaps a pavilion for some hunting place or park.\nThe sketch of columns marked \"35\" gives an example of columns shaped\nlike candelabra, a form often employed at that time, particularly in\nMilan, and the surrounding districts for instance in the Cortile di\nCasa Castiglione now Silvestre, in the cathedral of Como, at Porta\ndella Rana &c._\n\n769.\n\nCONCERNING ARCHITRAVES OF ONE OR SEVERAL PIECES.\n\nAn architrave of several pieces is stronger than that of one single\npiece, if those pieces are placed with their length in the direction\nof the centre of the world.

It would seem that\nLeonardo entertained the idea of writing a large and connected book\non Architecture; and it is quite evident that the materials we\npossess, which can be proved to have been written at different\nperiods, were noted down with a more or less definite aim and\npurpose. They might all be collected under the one title: \"Studies\non the Strength of Materials\". Among them the investigations on the\nsubject of fissures in walls are particularly thorough, and very\nfully reported; these passages are also especially interesting,\nbecause Leonardo was certainly the first writer on architecture who\never treated the subject at all. Here, as in all other cases\nLeonardo carefully avoids all abstract argument. His data are not\nderived from the principles of algebra, but from the laws of\nmechanics, and his method throughout is strictly experimental.\n\nThough the conclusions drawn from his investigations may not have\nthat precision which we are accustomed to find in Leonardo's\nscientific labours, their interest is not lessened. They prove at\nany rate his deep sagacity and wonderfully clear mind. No one\nperhaps, who has studied these questions since Leonardo, has\ncombined with a scientific mind anything like the artistic delicacy\nof perception which gives interest and lucidity to his observations.\n\nI do not assert that the arrangement here adopted for the passages\nin question is that originally intended by Leonardo; but their\ndistribution into five groups was suggested by the titles, or\nheadings, which Leonardo himself prefixed to most of these notes.\nSome of the longer sections perhaps should not, to be in strict\nagreement with this division, have been reproduced in their entirety\nin the place where they occur. But the comparatively small amount of\nthe materials we possess will render them, even so, sufficiently\nintelligible to the reader; it did not therefore seem necessary or\ndesirable to subdivide the passages merely for the sake of strict\nclassification._\n\n_The small number of chapters given under the fifth class, treating\non the centre of gravity in roof-beams, bears no proportion to the\nnumber of drawings and studies which refer to the same subject. Only\na small selection of these are reproduced in this work since the\nmajority have no explanatory text._\n\nI.\n\nON FISSURES IN WALLS.\n\n770.\n\nFirst write the treatise on the causes of the giving way of walls\nand then, separately, treat of the remedies.\n\nParallel fissures constantly occur in buildings which are erected on\na hill side, when the hill is composed of stratified rocks with an\noblique stratification, because water and other moisture often\npenetrates these oblique seams carrying in greasy and slippery soil;\nand as the strata are not continuous down to the bottom of the\nvalley, the rocks slide in the direction of the slope, and the\nmotion does not cease till they have reached the bottom of the\nvalley, carrying with them, as though in a boat, that portion of the\nbuilding which is separated by them from the rest. The remedy for\nthis is always to build thick piers under the wall which is\nslipping, with arches from one to another, and with a good scarp and\nlet the piers have a firm foundation in the strata so that they may\nnot break away from them.\n\nIn order to find the solid part of these strata, it is necessary to\nmake a shaft at the foot of the wall of great depth through the\nstrata; and in this shaft, on the side from which the hill slopes,\nsmooth and flatten a space one palm wide from the top to the bottom;\nand after some time this smooth portion made\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
