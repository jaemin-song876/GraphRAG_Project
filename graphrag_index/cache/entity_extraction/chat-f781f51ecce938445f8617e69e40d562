And if you were to say that these shells are desirous of\nremaining near to the margin of the sea, and that, as it rose in\nheight, the shells quitted their first home, and followed the\nincrease of the waters up to their highest level; to this I answer,\nthat the cockle is an animal of not more rapid movement than the\nsnail is out of water, or even somewhat slower; because it does not\nswim, on the contrary it makes a furrow in the sand by means of its\nsides, and in this furrow it will travel each day from 3 to 4\nbraccia; therefore this creature, with so slow a motion, could not\nhave travelled from the Adriatic sea as far as Monferrato in\nLombardy [Footnote: _Monferrato di Lombardia_. The range of hills of\nMonferrato is in Piedmont, and Casale di Monferrato belonged, in\nLeonardo's time, to the Marchese di Mantova.], which is 250 miles\ndistance, in 40 days; which he has said who took account of the\ntime. And if you say that the waves carried them there, by their\ngravity they could not move, excepting at the bottom. And if you\nwill not grant me this, confess at least that they would have to\nstay at the summits of the highest mountains, in the lakes which are\nenclosed among the mountains, like the lakes of Lario, or of Como\nand il Maggiore [Footnote: _Lago di Lario._ Lacus Larius was the\nname given by the Romans to the lake of Como. It is evident that it\nis here a slip of the pen since the the words in the MS. are: _\"Come\nLago di Lario o'l Magare e di Como,\"_ In the MS. after line 16 we\ncome upon a digression treating of the weight of water; this has\nhere been omitted. It is 11 lines long.] and of Fiesole, and of\nPerugia, and others.\n\nAnd if you should say that the shells were carried by the waves,\nbeing empty and dead, I say that where the dead went they were not\nfar removed from the living; for in these mountains living ones are\nfound, which are recognisable by the shells being in pairs; and they\nare in a layer where there are no dead ones; and a little higher up\nthey are found, where they were thrown by the waves, all the dead\nones with their shells separated, near to where the rivers fell into\nthe sea, to a great depth; like the Arno which fell from the\nGonfolina near to Monte Lupo [Footnote: _Monte Lupo_, compare 970,\n13; it is between Empoli and Florence.], where it left a deposit of\ngravel which may still be seen, and which has agglomerated; and of\nstones of various districts, natures, and colours and hardness,\nmaking one single conglomerate. And a little beyond the sandstone\nconglomerate a tufa has been formed, where it turned towards Castel\nFlorentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells\nlived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the\nturbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom\nof the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be\nseen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is\nwearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of\nshells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and\nvarious marine objects are found there. And if the earth of our\nhemisphere is indeed raised by so much higher than it used to be, it\nmust have become by so much lighter by the waters which it lost\nthrough the rift between Gibraltar and Ceuta; and all the more the\nhigher it rose, because the weight of the waters which were thus\nlost would be added to the earth in the other hemisphere. And if the\nshells had been carried by the muddy deluge they would have been\nmixed up, and separated from each other amidst the mud, and not in\nregular steps and layers-- as we see them now in our time.\n\nThe marine shells were not produced away from the sea.\n\n988.\n\nAs to those who say that shells existed for a long time and were\nborn at a distance from the sea, from the nature of the place and of\nthe cycles, which can influence a place to produce such\ncreatures--to them it may be answered: such an influence could not\nplace the animals all on one line, except those of the same sort and\nage; and not the old with the young, nor some with an operculum and\nothers without their operculum, nor some broken and others whole,\nnor some filled with sea-sand and large and small fragments of other\nshells inside the whole shells which remained open; nor the claws of\ncrabs without the rest of their bodies; nor the shells of other\nspecies stuck on to them like animals which have\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
