Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight\nline, then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated,\nsmaller, or equal to, or larger than the first.\n\n48.\n\nOF DRAWING OUTLINE.\n\nConsider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every\nobject, and the character of their undulations. And these\nundulations must be separately studied, as to whether the curves are\ncomposed of arched convexities or angular concavities.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the outline.\n\nThe boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The\nproposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is\na surface, which is not part of the body contained within that\nsurface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the\nmedium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its\nplace. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line\nforming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible\nthickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with\nlines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;\nfor not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but\ntheir parts will be invisible from distance.\n\n50.\n\nDefinition of Perspective.\n\n[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a\nthorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function\nsimply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of\nall the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there\nis no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where\nthese pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend\nthe lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will\nbring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must\nform a pyramid.]\n\n[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied\nto the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit\ntheir image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The _Pyramid_ is\nthe name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and\nedges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single\npoint.]\n\n[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may\npractically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own\nimage, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms\nthat every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;\nand bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or\nsmaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one\nfrom the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from\nthe surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance\nmeet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no\ndimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye\nreceives all the points of the cone.\n\n[Footnote: 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The\nparagraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are\nevidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;\nbut they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.]\n\n51.\n\nIN WHAT WAY THE EYE SEES OBJECTS PLACED IN FRONT OF IT.\n\nThe perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye.\n\nSupposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let\nthe small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line _s t_ be\nthe pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of\nthe eye, by means of the pupil, pass on at once and enter the pupil,\npassing through the crystalline humour, which does not interfere in\nthe pupil with the things seen by means of the light. And the pupil\nhaving received the objects, by means of the light, immediately\nrefers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line _a b_.\nAnd you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the\nintellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it\nby means of light, reach it by the line _a b;_ as, for instance, by\nthe line _b c_. For although the lines _m n_ and _f g_ may be seen\nby the pupil they are not perfectly taken in, because they do not\ncoincide with the line _a b_. And the proof is this: If the eye,\nshown above, wants to count the letters placed in front, the eye\nwill be obliged to turn from letter to letter, because it cannot\ndiscern them unless they lie in the line _a b;_ as, for instance, in\nthe line _a c_. All visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a\npyramid, and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it,\nin the centre of the pupil, as figured above.\n\n[Footnote: 51. In this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and\nimmovable; this is plain from line 11.]\n\nExperimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).\n\n52.\n\nPerspective is a rational demonstration\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
