Both have been lost in some wholly inexplicable manner.\nI cannot here enter into the remarkable history of this work; I can\nonly give an account of what has been preserved to us of Leonardo's\nscheme and preparations for executing it. The extent of the material\nin studies and drawings was till now quite unknown. Their\npublication here may give some adequate idea of the grandeur of this\nfamous work. The text given as No._ 669 _contains a description of\nthe particulars of the battle, but for the reasons given in the note\nto this text, I must abandon the idea of taking this passage as the\nbasis of my attempt to reconstruct the picture as the artist\nconceived and executed it.\n\nI may here remind the reader that Leonardo prepared the cartoon in\nthe Sala del Papa of Santa Maria Novella at Florence and worked\nthere from the end of October 1503 till February 1504, and then was\nbusied with the painting in the Sala del Consiglio in the Palazzo\ndella Signoria, till the work was interrupted at the end of May\n1506. (See Milanesi's note to Vasari pp. 43--45 Vol. IV ed. 1880.)\nVasari, as is well known, describes only one scene or episode of the\ncartoon--the Battle for the Standard in the foreground of the\ncomposition, as it would seem; and this only was ever finished as a\nmural decoration in the Sala del Consiglio. This portion of the\ncomposition is familiar to all from the disfigured copy engraved by\nEdelinck. Mariette had already very acutely observed that Edelinck\nmust surely have worked from a Flemish copy of the picture. There is\nin the Louvre a drawing by Rubens (No. 565) which also represents\nfour horsemen fighting round a standard and which agrees with\nEdelinck's engraving, but the engraving reverses the drawing. An\nearlier Flemish drawing, such as may have served as the model for\nboth Rubens and Edelinck, is in the Uffizi collection (see\nPhilpots's Photograph, No. 732). It seems to be a work of the second\nhalf of the XVIth century, a time when both the picture and the\ncartoon had already been destroyed. It is apparently the production\nof a not very skilled hand. Raphael Trichet du Fresne, 1651,\nmentions that a small picture by Leonardo himself of the Battle of\nthe Standard was then extant in the Tuileries; by this he probably\nmeans the painting on panel which is now in the possession of Madame\nTimbal in Paris, and which has lately been engraved by Haussoullier\nas a work by Leonardo. The picture, which is very carefully painted,\nseems to me however to be the work of some unknown Florentine\npainter, and probably executed within the first ten years of the\nXVIth century. At the same time, it would seem to be a copy not from\nLeonardo's cartoon, but from his picture in the Palazzo della\nSignoria; at any rate this little picture, and the small Flemish\ndrawing in Florence are the oldest finished copies of this episode\nin the great composition of the Battle of Anghiari.\n\nIn his Life of Raphael, Vasari tells us that Raphael copied certain\nworks of Leonardo's during his stay in Florence. Raphael's first\nvisit to Florence lasted from the middle of October 1504 till July\n1505, and he revisited it in the summer of 1506. The hasty sketch,\nnow in the possession of the University of Oxford and reproduced on\npage 337 also represents the Battle of the Standard and seems to\nhave been made during his first stay, and therefore not from the\nfresco but from the cartoon; for, on the same sheet we also find,\nbesides an old man's head drawn in Leonardo's style, some studies\nfor the figure of St. John the Martyr which Raphael used in 1505 in\nhis great fresco in the Church of San Severo at Perugia.\n\nOf Leonardo's studies for the Battle of Anghiari I must in the first\nplace point to five, on three of which--Pl. LII 2, Pl. LIII, Pl.\nLVI--we find studies for the episode of the Standard. The standard\nbearer, who, in the above named copies is seen stooping, holding on\nto the staff across his shoulder, is immediately recognisable as the\nleft-hand figure in Raphael's sketch, and we find it in a similar\nattitude in Leonardo's pen and ink drawing in the British\nMuseum--Pl. LII, 2--the lower figure to the right. It is not\ndifficult to identify the same figure in two more complicated groups\nin the pen and ink drawings, now in the Accademia at Venice--Pl.\nLIII, and Pl. LIV--where we also find some studies of foot soldiers\nfighting. On the sheet in the British Museum--Pl. LII, 2--we find,\namong others, one group of three horses galloping forwards: one\nhorseman is thrown and protects himself with his buckler against the\nlance thrusts of two others on horseback, who try to pierce him as\nthey ride past.
