The eye [out of doors] in an illuminated atmosphere\nsees darkness behind the windows of houses which [nevertheless] are\nlight. 5th. All colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal\ndegree of darkness, among themselves. 6th. But all colours when\nplaced in a full light, never vary from their true and essential\nhue.\n\n25.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nFocus of sight.\n\nIf the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,\nit cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the\ntip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an\nobject can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and\nthe eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.\n\nDifferences of perception by one eye and by both eyes (26-29).\n\n26.\n\nOF THE EYE.\n\nWhen both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object, that object\nbecomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes.\n\n27.\n\nObjects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and\nsometimes small.\n\n28.\n\nThe motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it\nseem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the\nmoving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nObjects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,\nlook like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at\nthe spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if\nyou look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A\npicture can never contain in itself both aspects.\n\n29.\n\nLet the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look\nat the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,\nthe object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you\nshut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)\nspace _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer\nappear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture\nseen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief\ndoes when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one\neye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the\nsame conditions of light and shade?\n\n[Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,\nwhile the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose\nthat the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite\nto the spectator.]\n\n30.\n\nThe comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light\n(30-39).\n\nThe eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body\nbetter than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is\nin itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot\nbe distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot\nbe seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and\ngives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual\ndarkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.\n\n31.\n\nEvery object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,\nand larger in the morning than at midday.\n\nThis happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday\nthan at any other time.\n\n32.\n\nThe pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is\nevident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those\nin the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up\nat these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and\nif you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you\nwould see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil\nwould exercise its function.\n\n[Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]\n\n33.\n\nWhen the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,\nit will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at\nit. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when\nseen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear\nsmaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A\nluminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as\nit is farther from the eye.\n\n34.\n\nWhy when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look\ndark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the\nhalf light look very bright?\n\n35.\n\nON PAINTING.\n\nIf the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a\nplace in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.\nThis happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the\npupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more\nluminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
