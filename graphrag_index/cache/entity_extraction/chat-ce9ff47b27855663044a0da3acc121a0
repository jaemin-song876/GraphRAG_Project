This drawing was\nexhibited in 1879 at the _Ecole des Beaux-Arts_ in Paris and the\ncompilers of the catalogue amused themselves by giving the victim's\nname as follows: \"_Un pendu, vetu d'une longue robe, les mains li\u00e9es\nsur le dos ... Bernardo di Bendino Barontigni, marchand de\npantalons_\" (see _Catalogue descriptif des Dessins de Mailres\nanciens exposes a l'Ecole des Beaux Arts_, Paris 1879; No. 83, pp.\n9-10). Now, the criminal represented here, is none other than\nBernardino di Bandino Baroncelli the murderer of Giuliano de'Medici,\nwhose name as a coadjutor in the conspiracy of the Pazzi has gained\na melancholy notoriety by the tragedy of the 26th April 1478.\nBernardo was descended from an ancient family and the son of the man\nwho, under King Ferrante, was President of the High Court of Justice\nin Naples. His ruined fortunes, it would seem, induced him to join\nthe Pazzi; he and Francesco Pazzi were entrusted with the task of\nmurdering Giuliano de'Medici on the fixed day. Their victim not\nappearing in the cathedral at the hour when they expected him, the\ntwo conspirators ran to the palace of the Medici and induced him to\naccompany them. Giuliano then took his place in the chancel of the\nCathedral, and as the officiating priest raised the Host--the sign\nagreed upon--Bernardo stabbed the unsuspecting Giuliano in the\nbreast with a short sword; Giuliano stepped backwards and fell dead.\nThe attempt on Lorenzo's life however, by the other conspirators at\nthe same moment, failed of success. Bernardo no sooner saw that\nLorenzo tried to make his escape towards the sacristy, than he\nrushed upon him, and struck down Francesco Nori who endeavoured to\nprotect Lorenzo. How Lorenzo then took refuge behind the brazen\ndoors of the sacristy, and how, as soon as Giuliano's death was made\nknown, the further plans of the conspirators were defeated, while a\nterrible vengeance overtook all the perpetrators and accomplices,\nthis is no place to tell. Bernardo Bandini alone seemed to be\nfavoured by fortune; he hid first in the tower of the Cathedral, and\nthen escaped undiscovered from Florence. Poliziano, who was with\nLorenzo in the Cathedral, says in his 'Conjurationis Pactianae\nCommentarium': \"_Bandinus fugitans in Tiphernatem incidit, a quo in\naciem receptus Senas pervenit_.\" And Gino Capponi in summing up the\nreports of the numerous contemporary narrators of the event, says:\n\"_Bernardo Bandini ricoverato in Costantinopoli, fu per ordine del\nSultano preso e consegnato a un Antonio di Bernardino dei Medici,\nche Lorenzo aveva mandato apposta in Turchia: cos\u00ec era grande la\npotenza di quest' uomo e grande la voglia di farne mostra e che non\nrestasse in vita chi aveagli ucciso il fratello, fu egli applicato\nappena giunto_\" (_Storia della Republica di Firenze II_, 377, 378).\nDetails about the dates may be found in the _Chronichetta di\nBelfredello Strinati Alfieri_: \"_Bernardo di Bandino Bandini\nsopradetto ne venne preso da Gostantinopoti a d\u00ec 14. Dicembre 1479 e\ndisaminato, che fu al Bargello, fu impiccato alle finestre di detto\nBargello allato alla Doana a d\u00ec 29. Dicembre MCCCCLXXIX che pochi d\u00ec\nstette_.\" It may however be mentioned with reference to the mode of\nwriting the name of the assassin that, though most of his\ncontemporaries wrote Bernardo Bandini, in the _Breve Chronicon\nCaroli Petri de Joanninis_ he is called Bernardo di Bandini\nBaroncelli; and, in the _Sententiae Domini Matthaei de Toscana_,\nBernardus Joannis Bandini de Baroncellis, as is written on\nLeonardo's drawing of him when hanged. Now VASARI, in the life of\n_Andrea del Castagno_ (Vol. II, 680; ed. Milanesi 1878), tells us\nthat in 1478 this painter was commissioned by order of the Signoria\nto represent the members of the Pazzi conspiracy as traitors, on the\nfacade of the Palazzo del Podest\u00e0--the Bargello. This statement is\nobviously founded on a mistake, for Andrea del Castagno was already\ndead in 1457. He had however been commissioned to paint Rinaldo\ndegli Albizzi, when declared a rebel and exiled in 1434, and his\nadherents, as hanging head downwards; and in consequence he had\nacquired the nickname of Andrea degl' Impiccati. On the 21st July\n1478 the Council of Eight came to the following resolution: \"_item\nservatis etc. deliberaverunt et santiaverunt Sandro Botticelli pro\nejus labore in pingendo proditores flor. quadraginta largos_\" (see\nG.
