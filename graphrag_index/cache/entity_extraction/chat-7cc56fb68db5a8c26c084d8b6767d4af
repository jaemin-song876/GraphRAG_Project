B. 19. A further development of MS. B. 18, by employing for the\nfour principal chapels the type Pl. LXXXVIII No. 3, as we have\nalready seen in Pl. XCI No. 2; the exterior presents two varieties.\n\na) The outer contour follows the inner. [Footnote 2: These chapels\nare here sketched in two different sizes; it is the smaller type\nwhich is thus formed.]\n\nb) It is semicircular.\n\nPl. LXXXVII No. 2 (MS. B. 18b) Elevation to the first variation MS.\nB. 19. If we were not certain that this sketch was by Leonardo, we\nmight feel tempted to take it as a study by Bramante for St. Peter's\nat Rome. [Footnote 3: See_ Les projets primitifs Pl. 43._]_\n\n_MS. P. V. 39b. In the principal axes the chapels of MS. B. 19, and\nsemicircular niches on the diagonals. The exterior of the whole\nedifice is also an octagon, concealing the form of the interior\nchapels, but with its angles on their axes.\n\nGroup V.\n\nSuggested by San Lorenzo at Milan.\n\nIn MS. C. A. 266 IIb, 8l2b there is a plan almost identical with\nthat of San Lorenzo. The diagonal sides of the irregular octagon are\nnot indicated.\n\nIf it could be proved that the arches which, in the actual church,\nexist on these sides in the first story, were added in 1574 by\nMartimo Bassi, then this plan and the following section would be\nstill nearer the original state of San Lorenzo than at present. A\nreproduction of this slightly sketched plan has not been possible.\nIt may however be understood from Pl. LXXXVIII No. 3, by suppressing\nthe four pillars corresponding to the apses.\n\nPl. LXXXVII No. 1 shows the section in elevation corresponding with\nthe above-named plan. The recessed chapels are decorated with large\nshells in the halfdomes like the arrangement in San Lorenzo, but\nwith proportions like those of Bramante's Sacristy of Santa Maria\npresso S. Satiro.\n\nMS. C. A. 266; a sheet containing three views of exteriors of Domes.\nOn the same sheet there is a plan similar to the one above-named but\nwith uninterrupted aisles and with the addition of round chapels in\nthe axes (compare Pl. XCVII No. 3 and page 44 Fig. 1), perhaps a\nreminiscence of the two chapels annexed to San Lorenzo.--Leonardo\nhas here sketched the way of transforming this plan into a Latin\ncross by means of a nave with side aisles.\n\nPl. XCI No. 1. Plan showing a type deprived of aisles and comprised\nin a square building which is surrounded by a portico. It is\naccompanied by the following text:_\n\n756.\n\nThis edifice is inhabited [accessible] below and above, like San\nSepolcro, and it is the same above as below, except that the upper\nstory has the dome _c d_; and the [Footnote: The church of San\nSepolcro at Milan, founded in 1030 and repeatedly rebuilt after the\nmiddle of the XVIth century, still stands over the crypt of the\noriginal structure.] lower has the dome _a b_, and when you enter\ninto the crypt, you descend 10 steps, and when you mount into the\nupper you ascend 20 steps, which, with 1/3 braccio for each, make 10\nbraccia, and this is the height between one floor of the church and\nthe other.\n\n_Above the plan on the same sheet is a view of the exterior. By the\naid of these two figures and the description, sections of the\nedifice may easily be reconstructed. But the section drawn on the\nleft side of the building seems not to be in keeping with the same\nplan, notwithstanding the explanatory note written underneath it:\n\"dentro il difitio di sopra\" (interior of the edifice\nabove)[Footnote 1: _The small inner dome corresponds to_ a b _on the\nplan--it rises from the lower church into the upper-- above, and\nlarger, rises the dome_ c d. _The aisles above and below thus\ncorrespond_ (e di sopra come di sotto, salvoche etc.). _The only\ndifference is, that in the section Leonardo has not taken the\ntrouble to make the form octagonal, but has merely sketched circular\nlines in perspective._ J. P. R._].\n\n_Before leaving this group, it is well to remark that the germ of it\nseems already indicated by the diagonal lines in the plans Pl. LXXXV\nNo. 11 and No. 7. We shall find another application of the same type\nto the Latin cross in Pl. XCVII No. 3.\n\n_2.
