And this sea is 3000 miles long. Many times has the increase\nof its waters, heaped up by their backward flow and the blowing of\nthe West winds, caused the overflow of the Nile and of the rivers\nwhich flow out through the Black Sea, and have so much raised the\nseas that they have spread with vast floods over many countries. And\nthese floods take place at the time when the sun melts the snows on\nthe high mountains of Ethiopia that rise up into the cold regions of\nthe air; and in the same way the approach of the sun acts on the\nmountains of Sarmatia in Asia and on those in Europe; so that the\ngathering together of these three things are, and always have been,\nthe cause of tremendous floods: that is, the return flow of the sea\nwith the West wind and the melting of the snows. So every river will\noverflow in Syria, in Samaria, in Judea between Sinai and the\nLebanon, and in the rest of Syria between the Lebanon and the Taurus\nmountains, and in Cilicia, in the Armenian mountains, and in\nPamphilia and in Lycia within the hills, and in Egypt as far as the\nAtlas mountains. The gulf of Persia which was formerly a vast lake\nof the Tigris and discharged into the Indian Sea, has now worn away\nthe mountains which formed its banks and laid them even with the\nlevel of the Indian ocean. And if the Mediterranean had continued\nits flow through the gulf of Arabia, it would have done the same,\nthat is to say, would have reduced the level of the Mediterranean to\nthat of the Indian Sea.\n\nThe Red Sea. (1091. 1092).\n\n1091.\n\nFor a long time the water of the Mediterranean flowed out through\nthe Red Sea, which is 100 miles wide and 1500 long, and full of\nreefs; and it has worn away the sides of Mount Sinai, a fact which\ntestifies, not to an inundation from the Indian sea beating on these\ncoasts, but to a deluge of water which carried with it all the\nrivers which abound round the Mediterranean, and besides this there\nis the reflux of the sea; and then, a cutting being made to the West\n3000 miles away from this place, Gibraltar was separated from Ceuta,\nwhich had been joined to it. And this passage was cut very low down,\nin the plains between Gibraltar and the ocean at the foot of the\nmountain, in the low part, aided by the hollowing out of some\nvalleys made by certain rivers, which might have flowed here.\nHercules [Footnote 9: Leonardo seems here to mention Hercules half\njestingly and only in order to suggest to the reader an allusion to\nthe legend of the pillars of Hercules.] came to open the sea to the\nwestward and then the sea waters began to pour into the Western\nOcean; and in consequence of this great fall, the Red Sea remained\nthe higher; whence the water, abandoning its course here, ever after\npoured away through the Straits of Spain.\n\n1092.\n\nThe surface of the Red Sea is on a level with the ocean.\n\nA mountain may have fallen and closed the mouth of the Red Sea and\nprevented the outlet of the Mediterranean, and the Mediterranean Sea\nthus overfilled had for outlet the passage below the mountains of\nGades; for, in our own times a similar thing has been seen [Footnote\n6: Compare also No. 1336, ll. 30, 35 and 36.-- Paolo Giovio, the\ncelebrated historian (born at Como in 1483) reports that in 1513 at\nthe foot of the Alps, above Bellinzona, on the road to Switzerland,\na mountain fell with a very great noise, in consequence of an\nearthquake, and that the mass of rocks, which fell on the left\n(Western) side blocked the river Breno (T. I p. 218 and 345 of D.\nSauvage's French edition, quoted in ALEXIS PERCY, _Memoire des\ntremblements de terre de la peninsule italique; Academie Royale de\nBelgique._ T. XXII).--]; a mountain fell seven miles across a valley\nand closed it up and made a lake. And thus most lakes have been made\nby mountains, as the lake of Garda, the lakes of Como and Lugano,\nand the Lago Maggiore. The Mediterranean fell but little on the\nconfines of Syria, in consequence of the Gaditanean passage, but a\ngreat deal in this passage, because before this cutting was made the\nMediterranean sea flowed to the South East, and then the fall had to\nbe made by its run through the Straits of Gades.\n\nAt _a_ the water of the Mediterranean fell into the ocean.\n\nAll the plains which lie between the sea and mountains were formerly\ncovered with salt water.\n\nEvery valley has been made by its own river; and the proportion\nbetween valleys is the same as that between river and river.\n\nThe greatest river in our world is the Mediterranean river, which\nmoves from the sources of the Nile to the Western ocean.\n\nAnd its greatest height is in Outer Mauritania and it has a course\nof ten thousand miles before it reunites with its ocean, the father\nof the waters.\n\nThat is 3000 miles for the Mediterranean, 3000 for the Nile, as far\nas discovered and 3000 for the Nile which flows to the East, &c.\n\n[Footnote: See\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
