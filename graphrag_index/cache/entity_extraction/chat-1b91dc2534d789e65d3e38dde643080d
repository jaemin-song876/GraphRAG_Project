He\nwas then seized with a paroxysm, the forerunner of death, when King\nFrancis I., who was accustomed frequently and affectionately to visit\nhim, rose and supported his head to give him such assistance and to do\nhim such favour as he could in the hope of alleviating his sufferings.\nThe spirit of Leonardo, which was most divine, conscious that he could\nattain to no greater honour, departed in the arms of the monarch,\nbeing at that time in the seventy-fifth year of his age.\" The not\nover-veracious chronicler, however, is here drawing largely upon his\nimagination. Leonardo was only sixty-seven years of age, and the King\nwas in all probability on that date at St. Germain-en Laye!\n\nThus died \"Mr. Lionard de Vincy, the noble Milanese, painter,\nengineer, and architect to the King, State Mechanician\" and \"former\nProfessor of Painting to the Duke of Milan.\"\n\n\"May God Almighty grant him His eternal peace,\" wrote his friend and\nassistant Francesco Melzi. \"Every one laments the loss of a man whose\nlike Nature cannot produce a second time.\"\n\n\n\nHIS ART\n\nLeonardo, whose birth antedates that of Michelangelo and Raphael by\ntwenty three and thirty-one years respectively, was thus in the\nforefront of the Florentine Renaissance, his life coinciding almost\nexactly with the best period of Tuscan painting.\n\nLeonardo was the first to investigate scientifically and to apply to\nart the laws of light and shade, though the preliminary investigations\nof Piero della Francesca deserve to be recorded.\n\nHe observed with strict accuracy the subtleties of chiaroscuro--light\nand shade apart from colour; but, as one critic has pointed out, his\ngift of chiaroscuro cost the colour-life of many a noble picture.\nLeonardo was \"a tonist, not a colourist,\" before whom the whole book\nof nature lay open.\n\nIt was not instability of character but versatility of mind which\ncaused him to undertake many things that having commenced he\nafterwards abandoned, and the probability is that as soon as he saw\nexactly how he could solve any difficulty which presented itself, he\nput on one side the merely perfunctory execution of such a task.\n\nIn the Forster collection in the Victoria and Albert museum three of\nLeonardo's note-books with sketches are preserved, and it is stated\nthat it was his practice to carry about with him, attached to his\ngirdle, a little book for making sketches. They prove that he was\nleft-handed and wrote from right to left.\n\n\n\n\nHIS MIND\n\nWe can readily believe the statements of Benvenuto Cellini, the\nsixteenth-century Goldsmith, that Francis I. \"did not believe\nthat any other man had come into the world who had attained so great a\nknowledge as Leonardo, and that not only as sculptor, painter, and\narchitect, for beyond that he was a profound philosopher.\" It was\nCellini also who contended that \"Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and\nRaphael are the Book of the World.\"\n\nLeonardo anticipated many eminent scientists and inventors in the\nmethods of investigation which they adopted to solve the many problems\nwith which their names are coupled. Among these may be cited\nCopernicus' theory of the earth's movement, Lamarck's classification\nof vertebrate and invertebrate animals, the laws of friction,\nthe laws of combustion and respiration, the elevation of the\ncontinents, the laws of gravitation, the undulatory theory of light\nand heat, steam as a motive power in navigation, flying machines, the\ninvention of the camera obscura, magnetic attraction, the use of the\nstone saw, the system of canalisation, breech loading cannon, the\nconstruction of fortifications, the circulation of the blood, the\nswimming belt, the wheelbarrow, the composition of explosives, the\ninvention of paddle wheels, the smoke stack, the mincing machine! It\nis, therefore, easy to see why he called \"Mechanics the Paradise\nof the Sciences.\"\n\nLeonardo was a SUPERMAN.\n\n\n\n\nHIS MAXIMS\n\n\n    The eye is the window of the soul.\n\n    Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.\n\n    The natural desire of good men is knowledge.\n\n    A beautiful body perishes, but a work of art dies not.\n\n    Every difficulty can be overcome by effort.\n\n    Time abides long enough for those who make use of it.\n\n    Miserable men, how often do you enslave yourselves\n    to gain money!\n\n\n\n\nHIS SPELL\n\nThe influence of Leonardo was strongly felt in Milan, where he spent\nso many of the best years of his life and founded a School of\npainting. He was a close observer of the gradation and reflex of\nlight, and was capable of giving to his discoveries a practical and\naesthetic form. His strong personal character and the fascination of\nhis genius enthralled his followers, who were satisfied to repeat his\ntypes, to perpetuate the \"grey-hound eye,\" and to make use of his\nlittle devices. Among this group of painters may be mentioned\nBoltraffio, who perhaps painted the \"Presumed Portrait of Lucrezia\nCrivelli\" (Plate VII.), which is officially attributed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
