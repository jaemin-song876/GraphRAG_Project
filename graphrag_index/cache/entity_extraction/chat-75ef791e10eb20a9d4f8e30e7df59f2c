And this mixture you must express thus: The dust, being\na thing of earth, has weight; and although from its fineness it is\neasily tossed up and mingles with the air, it nevertheless readily\nfalls again. It is the finest part that rises highest; hence that\npart will be least seen and will look almost of the same colour as\nthe air. The higher the smoke mixed with the dust-laden air rises\ntowards a certain level, the more it will look like a dark cloud;\nand it will be seen that at the top, where the smoke is more\nseparate from the dust, the smoke will assume a bluish tinge and the\ndust will tend to its colour. This mixture of air, smoke and dust\nwill look much lighter on the side whence the light comes than on\nthe opposite side. The more the combatants are in this turmoil the\nless will they be seen, and the less contrast will there be in their\nlights and shadows. Their faces and figures and their appearance,\nand the musketeers as well as those near them you must make of a\nglowing red. And this glow will diminish in proportion as it is\nremote from its cause.\n\nThe figures which are between you and the light, if they be at a\ndistance, will appear dark on a light background, and the lower part\nof their legs near the ground will be least visible, because there\nthe dust is coarsest and densest [19]. And if you introduce horses\ngalloping outside the crowd, make the little clouds of dust distant\nfrom each other in proportion to the strides made by the horses; and\nthe clouds which are furthest removed from the horses, should be\nleast visible; make them high and spreading and thin, and the nearer\nones will be more conspicuous and smaller and denser [23]. The air\nmust be full of arrows in every direction, some shooting upwards,\nsome falling, some flying level. The balls from the guns must have a\ntrain of smoke following their flight. The figures in the foreground\nyou must make with dust on the hair and eyebrows and on other flat\nplaces likely to retain it. The conquerors you will make rushing\nonwards with their hair and other light things flying on the wind,\nwith their brows bent down,\n\n[Footnote: 19--23. Compare 608. 57--75.]\n\n602.\n\nand with the opposite limbs thrust forward; that is where a man puts\nforward the right foot the left arm must be advanced. And if you\nmake any one fallen, you must show the place where he has slipped\nand been dragged along the dust into blood stained mire; and in the\nhalf-liquid earth arround show the print of the tramping of men and\nhorses who have passed that way. Make also a horse dragging the dead\nbody of his master, and leaving behind him, in the dust and mud, the\ntrack where the body was dragged along. You must make the conquered\nand beaten pale, their brows raised and knit, and the skin above\ntheir brows furrowed with pain, the sides of the nose with wrinkles\ngoing in an arch from the nostrils to the eyes, and make the\nnostrils drawn up--which is the cause of the lines of which I\nspeak--, and the lips arched upwards and discovering the upper\nteeth; and the teeth apart as with crying out and lamentation. And\nmake some one shielding his terrified eyes with one hand, the palm\ntowards the enemy, while the other rests on the ground to support\nhis half raised body. Others represent shouting with their mouths\nopen, and running away. You must scatter arms of all sorts among the\nfeet of the combatants, as broken shields, lances, broken swords and\nother such objects. And you must make the dead partly or entirely\ncovered with dust, which is changed into crimson mire where it has\nmingled with the flowing blood whose colour shows it issuing in a\nsinuous stream from the corpse. Others must be represented in the\nagonies of death grinding their teeth, rolling their eyes, with\ntheir fists clenched against their bodies and their legs contorted.\nSome might be shown disarmed and beaten down by the enemy, turning\nupon the foe, with teeth and nails, to take an inhuman and bitter\nrevenge. You might see some riderless horse rushing among the enemy,\nwith his mane flying in the wind, and doing no little mischief with\nhis heels. Some maimed warrior may be seen fallen to the earth,\ncovering himself with his shield, while the enemy, bending over him,\ntries to deal him a deathstroke. There again might be seen a number\nof men fallen in a heap over a dead horse. You would see some of the\nvictors leaving the fight and issuing from the crowd, rubbing their\neyes and cheeks with both hands to clean them of the dirt made by\ntheir watering eyes smarting from the dust and smoke. The reserves\nmay be seen standing, hopeful but cautious; with watchful eyes,\nshading them with their hands and gazing through the dense and murky\nconfusion, attentive to the commands of their captain. The captain\nhimself, his staff raised, hurries towards these auxiliaries,\npointing to the spot where they are most needed. And there may be a\nriver into which horses are galloping,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
