Now the sun reflected in the unruffled surface occupied the\nspace _c d_, while in the ruffled surface it covers all the watery\nspace _c e_ (as is proved in the 4th of my \"Perspective\") [Footnote\n9: _Nel quarto della mia prospettiva_. If this reference is to the\ndiagrams accompanying the text--as is usual with Leonardo--and not\nto some particular work, the largest of the diagrams here given must\nbe meant. It is the lowest and actually the fifth, but he would have\ncalled it the fourth, for the text here given is preceded on the\nsame page of the manuscript by a passage on whirlpools, with the\ndiagram belonging to it also reproduced here. The words _della mia\nprospettiva_ may therefore indicate that the diagram to the\npreceding chapter treating on a heterogeneal subject is to be\nexcluded. It is a further difficulty that this diagram belongs\nproperly to lines 9-10 and not to the preceding sentence. The\nreflection of the sun in water is also discussed in the Theoretical\npart of the Book on Painting; see Vol. I, No. 206, 207.] and it will\ncover more of the water in proportion as the reflected image is\nremote from the eye [10].\n\n[Footnote: In the original sketch, inside the circle in the first\ndiagram, is written _Sole_ (sun), and to the right of it _luna_\n(moon). Thus either of these heavenly bodies may be supposed to fill\nthat space. Within the lower circle is written _simulacro_ (image).\nIn the two next diagrams at the spot here marked _L_ the word _Luna_\nis written, and in the last _sole_ is written in the top circle at\n_a_.]\n\nThe image of the sun will be more brightly shown in small waves than\nin large ones--and this is because the reflections or images of the\nsun are more numerous in the small waves than in large ones, and the\nmore numerous reflections of its radiance give a larger light than\nthe fewer.\n\nWaves which intersect like the scales of a fir cone reflect the\nimage of the sun with the greatest splendour; and this is the case\nbecause the images are as many as the ridges of the waves on which\nthe sun shines, and the shadows between these waves are small and\nnot very dark; and the radiance of so many reflections together\nbecomes united in the image which is transmitted to the eye, so that\nthese shadows are imperceptible.\n\nThat reflection of the sun will cover most space on the surface of\nthe water which is most remote from the eye which sees it.\n\nLet _a_ be the sun, _p q_ the reflection of the sun; _a b_ is the\nsurface of the water, in which the sun is mirrored, and _r_ the eye\nwhich sees this reflection on the surface of the water occupying the\nspace _o m_. _c_ is the eye at a greater distance from the surface\nof the water and also from the reflection; hence this reflection\ncovers a larger space of water, by the distance between _n_ and _o_.\n\n876.\n\nIt is impossible that the side of a spherical mirror, illuminated by\nthe sun, should reflect its radiance unless this mirror were\nundulating or filled with bubbles.\n\nYou see here the sun which lights up the moon, a spherical mirror,\nand all of its surface, which faces the sun is rendered radiant.\n\nWhence it may be concluded that what shines in the moon is water\nlike that of our seas, and in waves as that is; and that portion\nwhich does not shine consists of islands and terra firma.\n\nThis diagram, of several spherical bodies interposed between the eye\nand the sun, is given to show that, just as the reflection of the\nsun is seen in each of these bodies, in the same way that image may\nbe seen in each curve of the waves of the sea; and as in these many\nspheres many reflections of the sun are seen, so in many waves there\nare many images, each of which at a great distance is much magnified\nto the eye. And, as this happens with each wave, the spaces\ninterposed between the waves are concealed; and, for this reason, it\nlooks as though the many suns mirrored in the many waves were but\none continuous sun; and the shadows,, mixed up with the luminous\nimages, render this radiance less brilliant than that of the sun\nmirrored in these waves.\n\n[Footnote: In the original, at letter _A_ in the diagram \"_Sole_\"\n(the sun) is written, and at _o_ \"_occhio_\" (the eye).]\n\n877.\n\nThis will have before it the treatise on light and shade.\n\nThe edges in the moon will be most strongly lighted and reflect most\nlight, because, there, nothing will be visible but the tops of the\nwaves of the water [Footnote 5: I have thought it unnecessary to\nreproduce the detailed explanation of the theory of reflection on\nwaves contained in the passage which follows this.].\n\n878.\n\nThe sun will appear larger in moving water or on waves than in still\nwater; an example is the light reflected on the strings of a\nmonochord.\n\nII.\n\nTHE SUN.\n\nThe question of the true and of the apparent size of the sun\n(879-884).\n\n879.\n\nIN PRAISE OF THE SUN.\n\nIf you look at the stars, cutting off the rays (as may be done by\nlooking through a very small hole made\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
