Supposing that through a channel one mile wide there\nflows one mile in length of water; where the river is five miles\nwide each of the 5 square miles will require 1/5 of itself to be\nequal to the square mile of water required in the sea, and where the\nriver is 3 miles wide each of these square miles will require the\nthird of its volume to make up the amount of the square mile of the\nnarrow part; as is demonstrated in _f g h_ at the mile marked _n_.\n\n[Footnote: In the place marked A in the diagram _Mare Mediterano_\n(Mediterranean Sea) is written in the original. And at B, _stretto\ndi Spugna_ (straits of Spain, _i.e._ Gibraltar). Compare No. 960.]\n\n1084.\n\nWHY THE CURRENT OF GIBRALTAR IS ALWAYS GREATER TO THE WEST THAN TO\nTHE EAST.\n\nThe reason is that if you put together the mouths of the rivers\nwhich discharge into the Mediterranean sea, you would find the sum\nof water to be larger than that which this sea pours through the\nstraits into the ocean. You see Africa discharging its rivers that\nrun northwards into this sea, and among them the Nile which runs\nthrough 3000 miles of Africa; there is also the Bagrada river and\nthe Schelif and others. [Footnote 5: _Bagrada_ (Leonardo writes\nBragada) in Tunis, now Medscherda; _Mavretano_, now Schelif.]\nLikewise Europe pours into it the Don and the Danube, the Po, the\nRhone, the Arno, and the Tiber, so that evidently these rivers, with\nan infinite number of others of less fame, make its great breadth\nand depth and current; and the sea is not wider than 18 miles at the\nmost westerly point of land where it divides Europe from Africa.\n\n1085.\n\nThe gulf of the Mediterranean, as an inland sea, received the\nprincipal waters of Africa, Asia and Europe that flowed towards it;\nand its waters came up to the foot of the mountains that surrounded\nit and made its shores. And the summits of the Apennines stood up\nout of this sea like islands, surrounded by salt water. Africa\nagain, behind its Atlas mountains did not expose uncovered to the\nsky the surface of its vast plains about 3000 miles in length, and\nMemphis [Footnote 6: _Mefi._ Leonardo can only mean here the citadel\nof Cairo on the Mokattam hills.] was on the shores of this sea, and\nabove the plains of Italy, where now birds fly in flocks, fish were\nwont to wander in large shoals.\n\n1086.\n\nTunis.\n\nThe greatest ebb made anywhere by the Mediterranean is above Tunis,\nbeing about two and a half braccia and at Venice it falls two\nbraccia. In all the rest of the Mediterranean sea the fall is little\nor none.\n\n1087.\n\nLibya.\n\nDescribe the mountains of shifting deserts; that is to say the\nformation of waves of sand borne by the wind, and of its mountains\nand hills, such as occur in Libya. Examples may be seen on the wide\nsands of the Po and the Ticino, and other large rivers.\n\n1088.\n\nMajorca.\n\nCircumfulgore is a naval machine. It was an invention of the men of\nMajorca. [Footnote: The machine is fully described in the MS. and\nshown in a sketch.]\n\n1089.\n\nThe Tyrrhene Sea.\n\nSome at the Tyrrhene sea employ this method; that is to say they\nfastened an anchor to one end of the yard, and to the other a cord,\nof which the lower end was fastened to an anchor; and in battle they\nflung this anchor on to the oars of the opponent's boat and by the\nuse of a capstan drew it to the side; and threw soft soap and tow,\ndaubed with pitch and set ablaze, on to that side where the anchor\nhung; so that in order to escape that fire, the defenders of that\nship had to fly to the opposite side; and in doing this they aided\nto the attack, because the galley was more easily drawn to the side\nby reason of the counterpoise. [Footnote: This text is illustrated\nin the original by a pen and ink sketch.]\n\nIV.\n\nTHE LEVANT.\n\nThe Levantine Sea.\n\n1090.\n\nOn the shores of the Mediterranean 300 rivers flow, and 40, 200\nports. And this sea is 3000 miles long. Many times has the increase\nof its waters, heaped up by their backward flow and the blowing of\nthe West winds, caused the overflow of the Nile and of the rivers\nwhich flow out through the Black Sea, and have so much raised the\nseas that they have spread with vast floods over many countries.
