And by [following] this rule you will add greatly to the\nrelief of your figures.\n\n564.\n\nA most important part of painting consists in the backgrounds of the\nobjects represented; against these backgrounds the outlines of\nthose natural objects which are convex are always visible, and also\nthe forms of these bodies against the background, even though the\ncolours of the bodies should be the same as that of the background.\nThis is caused by the convex edges of the objects not being\nilluminated in the same way as, by the same light, the background is\nilluminated, since these edges will often be lighter or darker than\nthe background. But if the edge is of the same colour as the\nbackground, beyond a doubt it will in that part of the picture\ninterfere with your perception of the outline, and such a choice in\na picture ought to be rejected by the judgment of good painters,\ninasmuch as the purpose of the painter is to make his figures appear\ndetached from the background; while in the case here described the\ncontrary occurs, not only in the picture, but in the objects\nthemselves.\n\n565.\n\nThat you ought, when representing objects above the eye and on one\nside--if you wish them to look detached from the wall--to show,\nbetween the shadow on the object and the shadow it casts a middle\nlight, so that the body will appear to stand away from the wall.\n\nOn the lighting of white objects.\n\n566.\n\nHOW WHITE BODIES SHOULD BE REPRESENTED.\n\nIf you are representing a white body let it be surrounded by ample\nspace, because as white has no colour of its own, it is tinged and\naltered in some degree by the colour of the objects surrounding it.\nIf you see a woman dressed in white in the midst of a landscape,\nthat side which is towards the sun is bright in colour, so much so\nthat in some portions it will dazzle the eyes like the sun itself;\nand the side which is towards the atmosphere,--luminous through\nbeing interwoven with the sun's rays and penetrated by them--since\nthe atmosphere itself is blue, that side of the woman's figure will\nappear steeped in blue. If the surface of the ground about her be\nmeadows and if she be standing between a field lighted up by the sun\nand the sun itself, you will see every portion of those folds which\nare towards the meadow tinged by the reflected rays with the colour\nof that meadow. Thus the white is transmuted into the colours of the\nluminous and of the non-luminous objects near it.\n\nThe methods of aerial (567--570).\n\n567.\n\nWHY FACES [SEEN] AT A DISTANCE LOOK DARK.\n\nWe see quite plainly that all the images of visible objects that lie\nbefore us, whether large or small, reach our sense by the minute\naperture of the eye; and if, through so small a passage the image\ncan pass of the vast extent of sky and earth, the face of a\nman--being by comparison with such large images almost nothing by\nreason of the distance which diminishes it,--fills up so little of\nthe eye that it is indistinguishable. Having, also, to be\ntransmitted from the surface to the sense through a dark medium,\nthat is to say the crystalline lens which looks dark, this image,\nnot being strong in colour becomes affected by this darkness on its\npassage, and on reaching the sense it appears dark; no other reason\ncan in any way be assigned. If the point in the eye is black, it is\nbecause it is full of a transparent humour as clear as air and acts\nlike a perforation in a board; on looking into it it appears dark\nand the objects seen through the bright air and a dark one become\nconfused in this darkness.\n\nWHY A MAN SEEN AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE IS NOT RECOGNISABLE.\n\nThe perspective of diminution shows us that the farther away an\nobject is the smaller it looks. If you look at a man at a distance\nfrom you of an arrow's flight, and hold the eye of a small needle\nclose to your own eye, you can see through it several men whose\nimages are transmitted to the eye and will all be comprised within\nthe size of the needle's eye; hence, if the man who is at the\ndistance of an arrow's flight can send his whole image to your eye,\noccupying only a small space in the needle's eye how can you\n[expect] in so small a figure to distinguish or see the nose or\nmouth or any detail of his person? and, not seeing these you cannot\nrecognise the man, since these features, which he does not show, are\nwhat give men different aspects.\n\n568.\n\nTHE REASON WHY SMALL FIGURES SHOULD NOT BE MADE FINISHED.\n\nI say that the reason that objects appear diminished in size is\nbecause they are remote from the eye; this being the case it is\nevident that there must be a great extent of atmosphere between the\neye and the objects, and this air interferes with the distinctness\nof the forms of the object. Hence the minute details of these\nobjects will be indistinguishable and unrecognisable. Therefore, O\nPainter, make your smaller figures merely indicated and not highly\nfinished, otherwise you will produce effects the opposite to nature,\nyour supreme guide. The object is small by reason of the great\ndistance between it and the eye, this great distance is filled with\nair, that mass of air forms a dense body which intervenes and\nprevents the eye seeing the minute\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
