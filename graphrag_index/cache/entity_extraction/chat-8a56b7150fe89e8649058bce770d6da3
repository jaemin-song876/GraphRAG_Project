Hence a painting done on copper\nwhich as I said of painting may be added to or altered, resembles\nsculpture in bronze, which, having first been made in wax could then\nbe altered or added to; and if sculpture in bronze is durable, this\nwork in copper and enamel is absolutely imperishable. Bronze is but\ndark and rough after all, but this latter is covered with various\nand lovely colours in infinite variety, as has been said above; or\nif you will have me only speak of painting on panel, I am content to\npronounce between it and sculpture; saying that painting is the more\nbeautiful and the more imaginative and the more copious, while\nsculpture is the more durable but it has nothing else. Sculpture\nshows with little labour what in painting appears a miraculous thing\nto do; to make what is impalpable appear palpable, flat objects\nappear in relief, distant objects seem close. In fact painting is\nadorned with infinite possibilities which sculpture cannot command.\n\nAphorisms (657-659).\n\n657.\n\nOF PAINTING.\n\nMen and words are ready made, and you, O Painter, if you do not know\nhow to make your figures move, are like an orator who knows not how\nto use his words.\n\n658.\n\nAs soon as the poet ceases to represent in words what exists in\nnature, he in fact ceases to resemble the painter; for if the poet,\nleaving such representation, proceeds to describe the flowery and\nflattering speech of the figure, which he wishes to make the\nspeaker, he then is an orator and no longer a poet nor a painter.\nAnd if he speaks of the heavens he becomes an astrologer, and\nphilosopher; and a theologian, if he discourses of nature or God.\nBut, if he restricts himself to the description of objects, he would\nenter the lists against the painter, if with words he could satisfy\nthe eye as the painter does.\n\n659.\n\nThough you may be able to tell or write the exact description of\nforms, the painter can so depict them that they will appear alive,\nwith the shadow and light which show the expression of a face; which\nyou cannot accomplish with the pen though it can be achieved by the\nbrush.\n\nOn the history of painting (660. 661).\n\n660.\n\nTHAT PAINTING DECLINES AND DETERIORATES FROM AGE TO AGE, WHEN\nPAINTERS HAVE NO OTHER STANDARD THAN PAINTING ALREADY DONE.\n\nHence the painter will produce pictures of small merit if he takes\nfor his standard the pictures of others. But if he will study from\nnatural objects he will bear good fruit; as was seen in the painters\nafter the Romans who always imitated each other and so their art\nconstantly declined from age to age. After these came Giotto the\nFlorentine who--not content with imitating the works of Cimabue his\nmaster--being born in the mountains and in a solitude inhabited only\nby goats and such beasts, and being guided by nature to his art,\nbegan by drawing on the rocks the movements of the goats of which he\nwas keeper. And thus he began to draw all the animals which were to\nbe found in the country, and in such wise that after much study he\nexcelled not only all the masters of his time but all those of many\nbygone ages. Afterwards this art declined again, because everyone\nimitated the pictures that were already done; thus it went on from\ncentury to century until Tomaso, of Florence, nicknamed Masaccio,\nshowed by his perfect works how those who take for their standard\nany one but nature--the mistress of all masters--weary themselves in\nvain. And, I would say about these mathematical studies that those\nwho only study the authorities and not the works of nature are\ndescendants but not sons of nature the mistress of all good authors.\nOh! how great is the folly of those who blame those who learn from\nnature [Footnote 22: _lasciando stare li autori_. In this\nobservation we may detect an indirect evidence that Leonardo\nregarded his knowledge of natural history as derived from his own\ninvestigations, as well as his theories of perspective and optics.\nCompare what he says in praise of experience (Vol II; _XIX_).],\nsetting aside those authorities who themselves were the disciples of\nnature.\n\n661.\n\nThat the first drawing was a simple line drawn round the shadow of a\nman cast by the sun on a wall.\n\nThe painter's scope.\n\n662.\n\nThe painter strives and competes with nature.\n\n_X.\n\nStudies and Sketches for Pictures and Decorations.\n\nAn artist's manuscript notes can hardly be expected to contain any\nthing more than incidental references to those masterpieces of his\nwork of which the fame, sounded in the writings of his\ncontemporaries, has left a glorious echo to posterity. We need not\ntherefore be surprised to find that the texts here reproduced do not\nafford us such comprehensive information as we could wish. On the\nother hand, the sketches and studies prepared by Leonardo for the\ntwo grandest compositions he ever executed: The Fresco of the Last\nSupper in the Refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie at Milan, and\nthe Cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari, for the Palazzo della\nSignoria at Florence--have been preserved; and, though far from\ncomplete, are so much more numerous than the manuscript notes, that\nwe are justified in asserting that in value and interest they amply\ncompensate for the meagerness of the written suggestions.\n\nThe\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
