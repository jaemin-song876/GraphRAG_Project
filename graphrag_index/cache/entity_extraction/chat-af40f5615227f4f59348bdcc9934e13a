Let _c f_ be a broad light and _n_ be the object in\nfront of it, casting a shadow on the plane, and let _a b_ be the\nplane. It is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the\nshadow _n_ on the plane, but that the light has within it a centre\nis shown by this experiment. The shadow falls on the plane as is\nshown at _m o t r_.\n\n[Footnote 13: In the original MS. no explanatory text is placed\nafter this title-line; but a space is left for it and the text\nbeginning at line 15 comes next.] Why, to two [eyes] or in front of\ntwo eyes do 3 objects appear as two?\n\nWhy, when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights\nthe nearer appears confused. I say that the eye projects an infinite\nnumber of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to\nit from the object looked at. And it is only the central and\nsensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects;\nall the others are false and illusory. And if you place 2 objects at\nhalf an arm's length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the\neye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second;\nthe reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of\nfalse lines than the second and so is rendered vague.\n\nLight acts in the same manner, for in the effects of its lines\n(=rays), and particularly in perspective, it much resembles the eye;\nand its central rays are what cast the true shadow. When the object\nin front of it is too quickly overcome with dim rays it will cast a\nbroad and disproportionate shadow, ill defined; but when the object\nwhich is to cast the shadow and cuts off the rays near to the place\nwhere the shadow falls, then the shadow is distinct; and the more so\nin proportion as the light is far off, because at a long distance\nthe central ray is less overcome by false rays; because the lines\nfrom the eye and the solar and other luminous rays passing through\nthe atmosphere are obliged to travel in straight lines. Unless they\nare deflected by a denser or rarer air, when they will be bent at\nsome point, but so long as the air is free from grossness or\nmoisture they will preserve their direct course, always carrying the\nimage of the object that intercepts them back to their point of\norigin. And if this is the eye, the intercepting object will be seen\nby its colour, as well as by form and size. But if the intercepting\nplane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker\nchamber--not darker in colour, but by absence of light--you will see\nthe rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane\nbeyond all the details of the object they proceed from both as to\ncolour and form; only every thing will be upside down. But the size\n[of the image] where the lines are reconstructed will be in\nproportion to the relative distance of the aperture from the plane\non which the lines fall [on one hand] and from their origin [on the\nother]. There they intersect and form 2 pyramids with their point\nmeeting [a common apex] and their bases opposite. Let _a b_ be the\npoint of origin of the lines, _d e_ the first plane, and _c_ the\naperture with the intersection of the lines; _f g_ is the inner\nplane. You will find that _a_ falls upon the inner plane below at\n_g_, and _b_ which is below will go up to the spot _f_; it will be\nquite evident to experimenters that every luminous body has in\nitself a core or centre, from which and to which all the lines\nradiate which are sent forth by the surface of the luminous body and\nreflected back to it; or which, having been thrown out and not\nintercepted, are dispersed in the air.\n\n131.\n\nTHE RAYS WHETHER SHADED OR LUMINOUS HAVE GREATER STRENGTH AND EFFECT\nAT THEIR POINTS THAN AT THEIR SIDES.\n\nAlthough the points of luminous pyramids may extend into shaded\nplaces and those of pyramids of shadow into illuminated places, and\nthough among the luminous pyramids one may start from a broader base\nthan another; nevertheless, if by reason of their various length\nthese luminous pyramids acquire angles of equal size their light\nwill be equal; and the case will be the same with the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
