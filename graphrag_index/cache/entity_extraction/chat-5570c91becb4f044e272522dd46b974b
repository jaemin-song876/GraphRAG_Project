And the proportion of the diminution\nwill be in proportion to the relative distance of the objects from\nthe eye before they were removed.\n\nThat is to say in the object _t_ and the object _e_ the proportion\nof their distances from the eye _a_ is quintuple. I remove each from\nits place and set it farther from the eye by one of the 5 parts into\nwhich the proposition is divided. Hence it happens that the nearest\nto the eye has doubled the distance and according to the last\nproposition but one of this, is diminished by the half of its whole\nsize; and the body _e_, by the same motion, is diminished 1/5 of its\nwhole size. Therefore, by that same last proposition but one, that\nwhich is said in this last proposition is true; and this I say of\nthe motions of the celestial bodies which are more distant by 3500\nmiles when setting than when overhead, and yet do not increase or\ndiminish in any sensible degree.\n\n871.\n\n_a b_ is the aperture through which the sun passes, and if you could\nmeasure the size of the solar rays at _n m_, you could accurately\ntrace the real lines of the convergence of the solar rays, the\nmirror being at _a b_, and then show the reflected rays at equal\nangles to _n m_; but, as you want to have them at _n m_, take them\nat the. inner side of the aperture at cd, where they maybe measured\nat the spot where the solar rays fall. Then place your mirror at the\ndistance _a b_, making the rays _d b_, _c a_ fall and then be\nreflected at equal angles towards _c d_; and this is the best\nmethod, but you must use this mirror always in the same month, and\nthe same day, and hour and instant, and this will be better than at\nno fixed time because when the sun is at a certain distance it\nproduces a certain pyramid of rays.\n\n872.\n\n_a_, the side of the body in light and shade _b_, faces the whole\nportion of the hemisphere bed _e f_, and does not face any part of\nthe darkness of the earth. And the same occurs at the point _o_;\ntherefore the space a _o_ is throughout of one and the same\nbrightness, and s faces only four degrees of the hemisphere _d e f g\nh_, and also the whole of the earth _s h_, which will render it\ndarker; and how much must be demonstrated by calculation. [Footnote:\nThis passage, which has perhaps a doubtful right to its place in\nthis connection, stands in the Manuscript between those given in\nVol. I as No. 117 and No. 427.]\n\n873.\n\nTHE REASON OF THE INCREASED SIZE OF THE SUN IN THE WEST.\n\nSome mathematicians explain that the sun looks larger as it sets,\nbecause the eye always sees it through a denser atmosphere, alleging\nthat objects seen through mist or through water appear larger. To\nthese I reply: No; because objects seen through a mist are similar\nin colour to those at a distance; but not being similarly diminished\nthey appear larger. Again, nothing increases in size in smooth\nwater; and the proof of this may be seen by throwing a light on a\nboard placed half under water. But the reason why the sun looks\nlarger is that every luminous body appears larger in proportion as\nit is more remote. [Footnote: Lines 5 and 6 are thus rendered by M.\nRAVAISSON in his edition of MS. A. \"_De meme, aucune chose ne croit\ndans l'eau plane, et tu en feras l'experience_ en calquant un ais\nsous l'eau.\"--Compare the diagrams in Vol. I, p. 114.]\n\nOn the luminosity of the Earth in the universal space (874-878).\n\n874.\n\nIn my book I propose to show, how the ocean and the other seas must,\nby means of the sun, make our world shine with the appearance of a\nmoon, and to the remoter worlds it looks like a star; and this I\nshall prove.\n\nShow, first that every light at a distance from the eye throws out\nrays which appear to increase the size of the luminous body; and\nfrom this it follows that 2 ...[Footnote 10: Here the text breaks\noff; lines 11 and fol. are written in the margin.].\n\n[11]The moon is cold and moist. Water is cold and moist. Thus our\nseas must appear to the moon as the moon does to us.\n\n875.\n\nThe waves in water magnify the image of an object reflected in it.\n\nLet _a_ be the sun, and _n m_ the ruffled water, _b_ the image of\nthe sun when the water is smooth. Let _f_ be the eye which sees the\nimage in all the waves included within the base of the triangle _c e\nf_. Now the sun reflected in the unruffled surface occupied the\nspace _c d_, while in the ruffled surface it covers all the watery\nspace _c e_ (as is proved in the 4th of my \"Perspective\") [Footnote\n9: _Nel quarto della mia prospettiva_.
