These mountains which very closely\napproach each other are parted by the river. They are to the right\nand left for the distance of 20 miles throughout of the same nature.\n>From mile to mile there are good inns. Above on the said river there\nare waterfalls of 400 braccia in height, which are fine to see; and\nthere is good living at 4 soldi the reckoning. This river brings\ndown a great deal of timber.\n\nVAL SASINA.\n\nVal Sasina runs down towards Italy; this is almost the same form and\ncharacter. There grow here many _mappello_ and there are great ruins\nand falls of water [Footnote 14: The meaning of _mappello_ is\nunknown.].\n\nVALLEY OF INTROZZO.\n\nThis valley produces a great quantity of firs, pines and larches;\nand from here Ambrogio Fereri has his timber brought down; at the\nhead of the Valtellina are the mountains of Bormio, terrible and\nalways covered with snow; marmots (?) are found there.\n\nBELLAGGIO.\n\nOpposite the castle Bellaggio there is the river Latte, which falls\nfrom a height of more than 100 braccia from the source whence it\nsprings, perpendicularly, into the lake with an inconceivable roar\nand noise. This spring flows only in August and September.\n\nVALTELLINA.\n\nValtellina, as it is called, is a valley enclosed in high and\nterrible mountains; it produces much strong wine, and there is so\nmuch cattle that the natives conclude that more milk than wine grows\nthere. This is the valley through which the Adda passes, which first\nruns more than 40 miles through Germany; this river breeds the fish\n_temolo_ which live on silver, of which much is to be found in its\nsands. In this country every one can sell bread and wine, and the\nwine is worth at most one soldo the bottle and a pound of veal one\nsoldo, and salt ten dinari and butter the same and their pound is 30\nounces, and eggs are one soldo the lot.\n\n1031.\n\nAt BORMIO.\n\nAt Bormio are the baths;--About eight miles above Como is the\nPliniana, which increases and ebbs every six hours, and its swell\nsupplies water for two mills; and its ebbing makes the spring dry\nup; two miles higher up there is Nesso, a place where a river falls\nwith great violence into a vast rift in the mountain. These\nexcursions are to be made in the month of May. And the largest bare\nrocks that are to be found in this part of the country are the\nmountains of Mandello near to those of Lecco, and of Gravidona\ntowards Bellinzona, 30 miles from Lecco, and those of the valley of\nChiavenna; but the greatest of all is that of Mandello, which has at\nits base an opening towards the lake, which goes down 200 steps, and\nthere at all times is ice and wind.\n\nIN VAL SASINA.\n\nIn Val Sasina, between Vimognio and Introbbio, to the right hand,\ngoing in by the road to Lecco, is the river Troggia which falls from\na very high rock, and as it falls it goes underground and the river\nends there. 3 miles farther we find the buildings of the mines of\ncopper and silver near a place called Pra' Santo Pietro, and mines\nof iron and curious things. La Grigna is the highest mountain there\nis in this part, and it is quite bare.\n\n[Footnote: 1030 and 1031.
