And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the\nobjects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a\nshady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.\nThis occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil\ngoes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the\ndarkness seem less.\n\n[Footnote 14: _La luce entrer\u00e0_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of\npupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many\nother places.]\n\n36.\n\nON PERSPECTIVE.\n\nThe eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and\ngoes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.\nAnd this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have\nrested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so\nmuch that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will\nhave lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they\nare also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A\nlittle bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and\nfrom the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this\nI should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of\nthe mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense\nof sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man\ndilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of\n(surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and\ncontract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and\ninto the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the\nlight, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an\neye, and from that I learnt it.\n\n37.\n\nExperiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,\nfrom the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as\nthe sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were\nto light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this\ndifference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts\nwith the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between\nthe eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by\nplacing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a\nstar; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the\nray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the\nstar diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.\n\n[Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the\naccompanying diagram.]\n\n38.\n\nThe pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every\ndegree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes\none and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;\nalthough most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects\ndoes not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we\nmay look at.\n\n39.\n\nThe eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for\nsome time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the\neye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After\nlooking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense\nbrightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the\neye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.\n\n_II.\n\nLinear Perspective.\n\nWe see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the\nauthor directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have\nintended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the\nart of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In\nsection 50 the theory of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" is distinctly and\nexpressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear\nperspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of\nsight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such\npassages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have\nproved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would\nbe rash to say any thing decisive on this point.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti treats of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" at some\nlength in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs\nwidely from Leonardo's in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may\nhave borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly\naccepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its\napplication in a perfectly original manner.\n\nThe axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed\nby explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal\napplication (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless\nvariations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his\nartistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far\nthis theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as\nthis, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist's point of\nview it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an\ninalienable condition of the existence\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
