But\nshe puts into them the soul of the body, which forms them that is\nthe soul of the mother which first constructs in the womb the form\nof the man and in due time awakens the soul that is to inhabit it.\nAnd this at first lies dormant and under the tutelage of the soul of\nthe mother, who nourishes and vivifies it by the umbilical vein,\nwith all its spiritual parts, and this happens because this\numbilicus is joined to the placenta and the cotyledons, by which the\nchild is attached to the mother. And these are the reason why a\nwish, a strong craving or a fright or any other mental suffering in\nthe mother, has more influence on the child than on the mother; for\nthere are many cases when the child loses its life from them, &c.\n\nThis discourse is not in its place here, but will be wanted for the\none on the composition of animated bodies--and the rest of the\ndefinition of the soul I leave to the imaginations of friars, those\nfathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration.\n\n[Footnote 57: _lettere incoronate_. By this term Leonardo probably\nunderstands not the Bible only, but the works of the early Fathers,\nand all the books recognised as sacred by the Roman Church.] I leave\nalone the sacred books; for they are supreme truth.\n\nOn the relations of the soul to the organs of sense.\n\n838.\n\nHOW THE FIVE SENSES ARE THE MINISTERS OF THE SOUL.\n\nThe soul seems to reside in the judgment, and the judgment would\nseem to be seated in that part where all the senses meet; and this\nis called the Common Sense and is not all-pervading throughout the\nbody, as many have thought. Rather is it entirely in one part.\nBecause, if it were all-pervading and the same in every part, there\nwould have been no need to make the instruments of the senses meet\nin one centre and in one single spot; on the contrary it would have\nsufficed that the eye should fulfil the function of its sensation on\nits surface only, and not transmit the image of the things seen, to\nthe sense, by means of the optic nerves, so that the soul--for the\nreason given above-- may perceive it in the surface of the eye. In\nthe same way as to the sense of hearing, it would have sufficed if\nthe voice had merely sounded in the porous cavity of the indurated\nportion of the temporal bone which lies within the ear, without\nmaking any farther transit from this bone to the common sense, where\nthe voice confers with and discourses to the common judgment. The\nsense of smell, again, is compelled by necessity to refer itself to\nthat same judgment. Feeling passes through the perforated cords and\nis conveyed to this common sense. These cords diverge with infinite\nramifications into the skin which encloses the members of the body\nand the viscera. The perforated cords convey volition and sensation\nto the subordinate limbs. These cords and the nerves direct the\nmotions of the muscles and sinews, between which they are placed;\nthese obey, and this obedience takes effect by reducing their\nthickness; for in swelling, their length is reduced, and the nerves\nshrink which are interwoven among the particles of the limbs; being\nextended to the tips of the fingers, they transmit to the sense the\nobject which they touch.\n\nThe nerves with their muscles obey the tendons as soldiers obey the\nofficers, and the tendons obey the Common [central] Sense as the\nofficers obey the general. [27] Thus the joint of the bones obeys\nthe nerve, and the nerve the muscle, and the muscle the tendon and\nthe tendon the Common Sense. And the Common Sense is the seat of the\nsoul [28], and memory is its ammunition, and the impressibility is\nits referendary since the sense waits on the soul and not the soul\non the sense. And where the sense that ministers to the soul is not\nat the service of the soul, all the functions of that sense are also\nwanting in that man's life, as is seen in those born mute and blind.\n\n[Footnote: The peculiar use of the words _nervo_, _muscolo_,\n_corda_, _senso comune_, which are here literally rendered by nerve,\nmuscle cord or tendon and Common Sense may be understood from lines\n27 and 28.]\n\nOn involuntary muscular action.\n\n839.\n\nHOW THE NERVES SOMETIMES ACT OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY COMMANDS FROM\nTHE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE SOUL.\n\nThis is most plainly seen; for you will see palsied and shivering\npersons move, and their trembling limbs, as their head and hands,\nquake without leave from their soul and their soul with all its\npower cannot prevent their members from trembling. The same thing\nhappens in falling sickness, or in parts that have been cut off, as\nin the tails of lizards. The idea or imagination is the helm and\nguiding-rein of the senses, because the thing conceived of moves the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
