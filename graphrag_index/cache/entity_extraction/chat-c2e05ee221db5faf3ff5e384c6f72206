It is not to be found, as I am\ninformed, among the late President's property, and no one appears to\nknow where it now is._\n\n_An attempted reconstruction of the Cartoon, which is not only\nunsuccessful but perfectly unfounded, is to be seen in the\nlithograph by Bergeret, published in Charles Blanc's \"Vies des\npeintres\" and reprinted in \"The great Artists. L. da Vinci\", p. 80.\nThis misleading pasticcio may now be rejected without hesitation._\n\n_There are yet a few original drawings by Leonardo which might be\nmentioned here as possibly belonging to the cartoon of the Battle;\nsuch as the pen and ink sketches on Pl. XXI and on Pl. XXXVIII, No.\n3, but we should risk too wide a departure from the domain of\nascertained fact._\n\n_With regard to the colours and other materials used by Leonardo the\nreader may be referred to the quotations from the accounts for the\npicture in question given by Milanesi in his edition of Vasari (Vol.\nIV, p. 44, note) where we find entries of a similar character to\nthose in Leonardo's note books for the year 1505; S. K. M. 12 (see\nNo. 636)._\n\n_That Leonardo was employed in designing decorations and other\npreparations for high festivals, particularly for the court of\nMilan, we learn not only from the writings of his contemporaries but\nfrom his own incidental allusions; for instance in MS. C. l5b (1),\nl. 9. In the arrangement of the texts referring to this I have\nplaced those first, in which historical personages are named--Nos.\n670-674. Among the descriptions of Allegorical subjects two texts\nlately found at Oxford have been included, Nos. 676 and 677. They\nare particularly interesting because they are accompanied by large\nsketches which render the meaning of the texts perfectly clear. It\nis very intelligible that in other cases, where there are no\nillustrative sketches, the notes must necessarily remain obscure or\nadmit of various interpretations. The literature of the time affords\nample evidence of the use of such allegorical representations,\nparticularly during the Carnival and in Leonardo's notes we find the\nCarnival expressly mentioned--Nos. 685 and 704. Vasari in his Life\nof Pontormo, particularly describes that artist's various\nundertakings for Carnival festivities. These very graphic\ndescriptions appear to me to throw great light in more ways than one\non the meaning of Leonardo's various notes as to allegorical\nrepresentations and also on mottoes and emblems--Nos. 681-702. In\npassing judgment on the allegorical sketches and emblems it must not\nbe overlooked that even as pictures they were always accompanied by\nexplanations in words. Several finished drawings of allegorical\ncompositions or figures have been preserved, but as they have no\ncorresponding explanation in the MSS. they had no claim to be\nreproduced here. The female figure on Pl. XXVI may perhaps be\nregarded as a study for such an allegorical painting, of which the\npurport would have been explained by an inscription._\n\nOn Madonna pictures.\n\n663.\n\n[In the autumn of] 1478 I began the two Madonna [pictures].\n\n[Footnote: Photographs of this page have been published by BRAUN,\nNo. 439, and PHILPOT, No. 718.\n\n1. _Incominciai_. We have no other information as to the two\npictures of the Madonna here spoken of. As Leonardo here tells us\nthat he had begun two Madonnas at the same time, the word\n'_incominciai_' may be understood to mean that he had begun at the\nsame time preparatory studies for two pictures to be painted later.\nIf this is so, the non-existence of the pictures may be explained by\nsupposing that they were only planned and never executed. I may here\nmention a few studies for pictures of the Madonna which probably\nbelong to this early time; particularly a drawing in silver-point on\nbluish tinted paper at Windsor--see Pl. XL, No. 3--, a drawing of\nwhich the details have almost disappeared in the original but have\nbeen rendered quite distinct in the reproduction; secondly a slight\npen and ink sketch in, the Codex VALLARDI, in the Louvre, fol. 64,\nNo. 2316; again a silver point drawing of a Virgin and child drawn\nover again with the pen in the His de la Salle collection also in\nthe Louvre, No. 101. (See Vicomte BOTH DE TAUZIA, _Notice des\ndessins de la collection His de la Salle, exposes au Louvre_. Paris\n1881, pp. 80, 81.) This drawing is, it is true, traditionally\nascribed to Raphael, but the author of the catalogue very justly\npoints out its great resemblance with the sketches for Madonnas in\nthe British Museum which are indisputably Leonardo's. Some of these\nhave been published by Mr. HENRY WALLIS in the Art Journal, New Ser.\nNo. 14, Feb. 1882. If the non-existence of the two pictures here\nalluded to justifies my hypothesis that only studies for such\npictures are meant by the text, it may also be supposed that the\ndrawings were made for some comrade in VERROCCHIO'S atelier.
