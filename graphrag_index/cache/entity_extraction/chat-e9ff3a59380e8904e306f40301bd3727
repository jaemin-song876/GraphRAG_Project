I shall\nsee you in prison before you see me burnt.\"\n\nA FABLE.\n\nThe laurel and the myrtle seeing the pear tree cut down cried out\nwith a loud voice: \"O pear-tree! whither are you going? Where is the\npride you had when you were covered with ripe fruits? Now you will\nno longer shade us with your mass of leaves.\" Then the pear-tree\nreplied: \"I am going with the husbandman who has cut me down and who\nwill take me to the workshop of a good sculptor who by his art will\nmake me take the form of Jove the god; and I shall be dedicated in a\ntemple and adored by men in the place of Jove, while you are bound\nalways to remain maimed and stripped of your boughs, which will be\nplaced round me to do me honour.\n\nA FABLE.\n\nThe chesnut, seeing a man upon the fig-tree, bending its boughs down\nand pulling off the ripe fruits, which he put into his open mouth\ndestroying and crushing them with his hard teeth, it tossed its long\nboughs and with a noisy rustle exclaimed: \"O fig! how much less are\nyou protected by nature than I. See how in me my sweet offspring are\nset in close array; first clothed in soft wrappers over which is the\nhard but softly lined husk; and not content with taking this care of\nme, and having given them so strong a shelter, on this she has\nplaced sharp and close-set spines so that the hand of man cannot\nhurt me.\" Then the fig-tree and her offspring began to laugh and\nhaving laughed she said: \"I know man to be of such ingenuity that\nwith rods and stones and stakes flung up among your branches he will\nbereave you of your fruits; and when they are fallen, he will\ntrample them with his feet or with stones, so that your offspring\nwill come out of their armour, crushed and maimed; while I am\ntouched carefully by their hands, and not like you with sticks and\nstones.\"\n\n1279.\n\nThe hapless willow, finding that she could not enjoy the pleasure of\nseeing her slender branches grow or attain to the height she wished,\nor point to the sky, by reason of the vine and whatever other trees\nthat grew near, but was always maimed and lopped and spoiled,\nbrought all her spirits together and gave and devoted itself\nentirely to imagination, standing plunged in long meditation and\nseeking, in all the world of plants, with which of them she might\nally herself and which could not need the help of her withes. Having\nstood for some time in this prolific imagination, with a sudden\nflash the gourd presented itself to her thoughts and tossing all her\nbranches with extreme delight, it seemed to her that she had found\nthe companion suited to her purpose, because the gourd is more apt\nto bind others than to need binding; having come to this conclusion\nshe awaited eagerly some friendly bird who should be the mediator of\nher wishes. Presently seeing near her the magpie she said to him: \"O\ngentle bird! by the memory of the refuge which you found this\nmorning among my branches, when the hungry cruel, and rapacious\nfalcon wanted to devour you, and by that repose which you have\nalways found in me when your wings craved rest, and by the pleasure\nyou have enjoyed among my boughs, when playing with your companions\nor making love--I entreat you find the gourd and obtain from her\nsome of her seeds, and tell her that those that are born of them I\nwill treat exactly as though they were my own flesh and blood; and\nin this way use all the words you can think of, which are of the\nsame persuasive purport; though, indeed, since you are a master of\nlanguage, I need not teach you.

And when he had scraped away with\nhis foot a small quantity of the earth near the willow, describing a\ncircle, with his beak he planted the grains, which in a short time\nbegan to grow, and by their growth and the branches to take up all\nthe boughs of the willow, while their broad leaves deprived it of\nthe beauty of the sun and sky.
