A few passages have been collected at the beginning of\nthis section, which prove that he had turned his mind to the\npractical problems of navigation, and more especially of naval\nwarfare. What we know for certain of his life gives us no data, it\nis true, as to when or where these matters came under his\nconsideration; but the fact remains certain both from these notes in\nhis manuscripts, and from the well known letter to Ludovico il Moro\n(No._ 1340_), in which he expressly states that he is as capable as\nany man, in this very department._\n\n_The numerous notes as to the laws and rationale of the flight of\nbirds, are scattered through several note-books. An account of these\nis given in the Bibliography of the manuscripts at the end of this\nwork. It seems probable that the idea which led him to these\ninvestigations was his desire to construct a flying or aerial\nmachine for man. At the same time it must be admitted that the notes\non the two subjects are quite unconnected in the manuscripts, and\nthat those on the flight of birds are by far the most numerous and\nextensive. The two most important passages that treat of the\nconstruction of a flying machine are those already published as Tav.\nXVI, No._ 1 _and Tav. XVIII in the_ \"Saggio delle opere di Leonardo\nda Vinci\" _(Milan_ 1872_). The passages--Nos._ 1120-1125--_here\nprinted for the first time and hitherto unknown--refer to the same\nsubject and, with the exception of one already published in the\nSaggio-- No._ 1126--_they are, so far as I know, the only notes,\namong the numerous observations on the flight of birds, in which the\nphenomena are incidentally and expressly connected with the idea of\na flying machine._\n\n_The notes on machines of war, the construction of fortifications,\nand similar matters which fall within the department of the\nEngineer, have not been included in this work, for the reasons given\non page_ 26 _of this Vol. An exception has been made in favour of\nthe passages Nos._ 1127 _and_ 1128, _because they have a more\ngeneral interest, as bearing on the important question: whence the\nMaster derived his knowledge of these matters. Though it would be\nrash to assert that Leonardo was the first to introduce the science\nof mining into Italy, it may be confidently said that he is one of\nthe earliest writers who can be proved to have known and understood\nit; while, on the other hand, it is almost beyond doubt that in the\nEast at that time, the whole science of besieging towns and mining\nin particular, was far more advanced than in Europe. This gives a\npeculiar value to the expressions used in No._ 1127.\n\n_I have been unable to find in the manuscripts any passage whatever\nwhich throws any light on Leonardo's great reputation as a musician.\nNothing therein illustrates VASARPS well-known statement:_ Avvenne\nche morto Giovan Galeazze duca di Milano, e creato Lodovico Sforza\nnel grado medesimo anno 1494, fu condotto a Milano con gran\nriputazione Lionardo al du\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
