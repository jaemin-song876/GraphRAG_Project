But these may remain in company of beasts; among\ntheir associates should be dogs and other animals full of rapine and\nthey may hunt with them after...., and then follow helpless beasts,\nwhich in time of great snows come near to your houses asking alms as\nfrom their master....\n\nOn spirits (1211--1213).\n\n1211.\n\nO mathematicians shed light on this error.\n\nThe spirit has no voice, because where there is a voice there is a\nbody, and where there is a body space is occupied, and this prevents\nthe eye from seeing what is placed behind that space; hence the\nsurrounding air is filled by the body, that is by its image.\n\n1212.\n\nThere can be no voice where there is no motion or percussion of the\nair; there can be no percussion of the air where there is no\ninstrument, there can be no instrument without a body; and this\nbeing so, a spirit can have neither voice, nor form, nor strength.\nAnd if it were to assume a body it could not penetrate nor enter\nwhere the passages are closed. And if any one should say that by\nair, compressed and compacted together, a spirit may take bodies of\nvarious forms and by this means speak and move with strength--to him\nI reply that when there are neither nerves nor bones there can be no\nforce exercised in any kind of movement made by such imaginary\nspirits.\n\nBeware of the teaching of these speculators, because their reasoning\nis not confirmed by experience.\n\n1213.\n\nOf all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which\ndeals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of Alchemy, which\ngives birth to simple and natural things. But it is all the more\nworthy of reprehension than alchemy, because it brings forth nothing\nbut what is like itself, that is, lies; this does not happen in\nAlchemy which deals with simple products of nature and whose\nfunction cannot be exercised by nature itself, because it has no\norganic instruments with which it can work, as men do by means of\ntheir hands, who have produced, for instance, glass &c. but this\nNecromancy the flag and flying banner, blown by the winds, is the\nguide of the stupid crowd which is constantly witness to the\ndazzling and endless effects of this art; and there are books full,\ndeclaring that enchantments and spirits can work and speak without\ntongues and without organic instruments-- without which it is\nimpossible to speak-- and can carry heaviest weights and raise\nstorms and rain; and that men can be turned into cats and wolves and\nother beasts, although indeed it is those who affirm these things\nwho first became beasts.\n\nAnd surely if this Necromancy did exist, as is believed by small\nwits, there is nothing on the earth that would be of so much\nimportance alike for the detriment and service of men, if it were\ntrue that there were in such an art a power to disturb the calm\nserenity of the air, converting it into darkness and making\ncoruscations or winds, with terrific thunder and lightnings rushing\nthrough the darkness, and with violent storms overthrowing high\nbuildings and rooting up forests; and thus to oppose armies,\ncrushing and annihilating them; and, besides these frightful storms\nmay deprive the peasants of the reward of their labours.--Now what\nkind of warfare is there to hurt the enemy so much as to deprive him\nof the harvest? What naval warfare could be compared with this? I\nsay, the man who has power to command the winds and to make ruinous\ngales by which any fleet may be submerged, --surely a man who could\ncommand such violent forces would be lord of the nations, and no\nhuman ingenuity could resist his crushing force. The hidden\ntreasures and gems reposing in the body of the earth would all be\nmade manifest to him. No lock nor fortress, though impregnable,\nwould be able to save any one against the will of the necromancer.\nHe would have himself carried through the air from East to West and\nthrough all the opposite sides of the universe. But why should I\nenlarge further upon this? What is there that could not be done by\nsuch a craftsman? Almost nothing, except to escape death. Hereby I\nhave explained in part the mischief and the usefulness, contained in\nthis art, if it is real; and if it is real why has it not remained\namong men who desire it so much, having nothing to do with any\ndeity? For I know that there are numberless people who would, to\nsatisfy a whim, destroy God and all the universe; and if this\nnecromancy, being, as it were, so necessary to men, has not been\nleft among them, it can never have existed, nor will it ever exist\naccording to the definition of the spirit, which is invisible in\nsubstance; for within the elements there are no incorporate things,\nbecause where there is no body, there is a vacuum; and no vacuum can\nexist in the elements because it would be immediately filled up.\nTurn over.\n\n1214.\n\nOF SPIRITS.\n\nWe have said, on the other side of this page, that the definition of\na spirit is a power conjoined to a body; because it cannot move of\nits own accord, nor can it have any kind of motion in space; and if\nyou were to say that it moves itself, this\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
