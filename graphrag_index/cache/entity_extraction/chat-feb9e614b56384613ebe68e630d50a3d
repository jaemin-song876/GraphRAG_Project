The reserves\nmay be seen standing, hopeful but cautious; with watchful eyes,\nshading them with their hands and gazing through the dense and murky\nconfusion, attentive to the commands of their captain. The captain\nhimself, his staff raised, hurries towards these auxiliaries,\npointing to the spot where they are most needed. And there may be a\nriver into which horses are galloping, churning up the water all\nround them into turbulent waves of foam and water, tossed into the\nair and among the legs and bodies of the horses. And there must not\nbe a level spot that is not trampled with gore.\n\n603.\n\nOF LIGHTING THE LOWER PARTS OF BODIES CLOSE TOGETHER, AS OF MEN IN\nBATTLE.\n\nAs to men and horses represented in battle, their different parts\nwill be dark in proportion as they are nearer to the ground on which\nthey stand. And this is proved by the sides of wells which grow\ndarker in proportion to their depth, the reason of which is that the\ndeepest part of the well sees and receives a smaller amount of the\nluminous atmosphere than any other part.\n\nAnd the pavement, if it be of the same colour as the legs of these\nsaid men and horses, will always be more lighted and at a more\ndirect angle than the said legs &c.\n\n604.\n\nOF THE WAY TO REPRESENT A NIGHT [SCENE].\n\nThat which is entirely bereft of light is all darkness; given a\nnight under these conditions and that you want to represent a night\nscene,--arrange that there shall be a great fire, then the objects\nwhich are nearest to this fire will be most tinged with its colour;\nfor those objects which are nearest to a coloured light participate\nmost in its nature; as therefore you give the fire a red colour, you\nmust make all the objects illuminated by it ruddy; while those which\nare farther from the fire are more tinted by the black hue of night.\nThe figures which are seen against the fire look dark in the glare\nof the firelight because that side of the objects which you see is\ntinged by the darkness of the night and not by the fire; and those\nwho stand at the side are half dark and half red; while those who\nare visible beyond the edges of the flame will be fully lighted by\nthe ruddy glow against a black background. As to their gestures,\nmake those which are near it screen themselves with their hands and\ncloaks as a defence against the intense heat, and with their faces\nturned away as if about to retire. Of those farther off represent\nseveral as raising their hands to screen their eyes, hurt by the\nintolerable glare.\n\nOf depicting a tempest (605. 606).\n\n605.\n\nDescribe a wind on land and at sea. Describe a storm of rain.\n\n606.\n\nHOW TO REPRESENT A TEMPEST.\n\nIf you wish to represent a tempest consider and arrange well its\neffects as seen, when the wind, blowing over the face of the sea and\nearth, removes and carries with it such things as are not fixed to\nthe general mass. And to represent the storm accurately you must\nfirst show the clouds scattered and torn, and flying with the wind,\naccompanied by clouds of sand blown up from the sea shore, and\nboughs and leaves swept along by the strength and fury of the blast\nand scattered with other light objects through the air. Trees and\nplants must be bent to the ground, almost as if they would follow\nthe course of the gale, with their branches twisted out of their\nnatural growth and their leaves tossed and turned about [Footnote\n11: See Pl. XL, No. 2.]. Of the men who are there some must have\nfallen to the ground and be entangled in their garments, and hardly\nto be recognized for the dust, while those who remain standing may\nbe behind some tree, with their arms round it that the wind may not\ntear them away; others with their hands over their eyes for the\ndust, bending to the ground with their clothes and hair streaming in\nthe wind. [Footnote 15: See Pl. XXXIV, the right hand lower sketch.]\nLet the sea be rough and tempestuous and full of foam whirled among\nthe lofty waves, while the wind flings the lighter spray through the\nstormy air, till it resembles a dense and swathing mist. Of the\nships that are therein some should be shown with rent sails and the\ntatters fluttering through the air, with ropes broken and masts\nsplit and fallen. And the ship itself lying in the trough of the sea\nand wrecked by the fury of the waves with the men shrieking and\nclinging to the fragments of the vessel. Make the clouds driven by\nthe impetuosity of the wind and flung against the lofty mountain\ntops, and wreathed and torn like waves beating upon rocks; the air\nitself terrible from the deep darkness caused by the dust and fog\nand heavy clouds.\n\nOf representing the deluge (607-609).\n\n607.\n\nTO REPRESENT THE DELUGE.\n\nThe air was darkened by the heavy rain whose oblique descent driven\naslant by the rush of the winds, flew in drifts through the air not\notherwise than as we see dust, varied only by the straight lines of\nthe heavy drops of falling water. But it was tinged with the colour\nof the fire kindled by the thunder-bolts by which the clouds were\nrent and shattered; and whose flashes revealed the broad waters of\nthe inundated valleys, above which\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
