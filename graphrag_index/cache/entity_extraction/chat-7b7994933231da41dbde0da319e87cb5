Vinci\nis still very inaccessible, and the only means of conveyance is the\ncart of a general carrier and postman, who sets out on his journey\nfrom Empoli at sunrise and sunset. Outside a house in the middle of\nthe main street of Vinci to-day a modern and white-washed bust of the\ngreat artist is pointed to with much pride by the inhabitants.\nLeonardo's traditional birthplace on the outskirts of the town still\nexists, and serves now as the headquarters of a farmer and small wine\nexporter.\n\nLeonardo di Ser Piero d'Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser Guido da\nVinci--for that was his full legal name--was the natural and\nfirst-born son of Ser Piero, a country notary, who, like his father,\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather, followed that honourable\nvocation with distinction and success, and who subsequently--when\nLeonardo was a youth--was appointed notary to the Signoria of\nFlorence. Leonardo's mother was one Caterina, who afterwards married\nAccabriga di Piero del Vaccha of Vinci.\n\n[Illustration: Plate II.--Annunciation\n\nIn the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. No. 1288. 3 ft 3 ins. By 6 ft 11 ins.\n(0.99 x 2.18)\n\nAlthough this panel is included in the Uffizi Catalogue as being by\nLeonardo, it is in all probability by his master, Verrocchio.]\n\nThe date of Leonardo's birth is not known with any certainty. His age\nis given as five in a taxation return made in 1457 by his grandfather\nAntonio, in whose house he was educated; it is therefore concluded\nthat he was born in 1452. Leonardo's father Ser Piero, who afterwards\nmarried four times, had eleven children by his third and fourth wives.\nIs it unreasonable to suggest that Leonardo may have had these numbers\nin mind in 1496-1498 when he was painting in his famous \"Last Supper\"\nthe figures of eleven Apostles and one outcast?\n\nHowever\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
