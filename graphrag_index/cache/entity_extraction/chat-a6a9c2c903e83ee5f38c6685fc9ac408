Each beam\nmust pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with\nsufficient chaining, because in consequence of earthquakes the beams\nare often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and\nfloors; whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls strongly\ntogether and the walls will hold the floors.

Since by expansion and shrinking\nof the timber produced by damp and dryness such floors often crack,\nand once cracked their divisions gradually produce dust and an ugly\neffect.

RAVAISSON, in his edition of MS. A gives a very different\nrendering of this passage translating it thus: _Les planchers qui\nsont soutenus par deux differentes natures de supports paraissent\navec le temps faits en voute a cholli_.]\n\nRemarks on the style of Leonardo's architecture.\n\nA few remarks may here be added on the style of Leonardo's\narchitectural studies. However incomplete, however small in scale,\nthey allow us to establish a certain number of facts and\nprobabilities, well worthy of consideration.\n\nWhen Leonardo began his studies the great name of Brunellesco was\nstill the inspiration of all Florence, and we cannot doubt that\nLeonardo was open to it, since we find among his sketches the plan\nof the church of Santo Spirito[Footnote 1: See Pl. XCIV, No. 2. Then\nonly in course of erection after the designs of Brunellesco, though\nhe was already dead; finished in 1481.] and a lateral view of San\nLorenzo (Pl. XCIV No. 1), a plan almost identical with the chapel\nDegli Angeli, only begun by him (Pl. XCIV, No. 3) while among\nLeonardo's designs for domes several clearly betray the influence of\nBrunellesco's Cupola and the lantern of Santa Maria del\nFiore[Footnote 2: A small sketch of the tower of the Palazzo della\nSignoria (MS. C.A. 309) proves that he also studied mediaeval\nmonuments.]\n\nThe beginning of the second period of modern Italian architecture\nfalls during the first twenty years of Leonardo's life. However the\nnew impetus given by Leon Battista Alberti either was not generally\nunderstood by his contemporaries, or those who appreciated it, had\nno opportunity of showing that they did so. It was only when taken\nup by Bramante and developed by him to the highest rank of modern\narchitecture that this new influence was generally felt. Now the\npeculiar feature of Leonardo's sketches is that, like the works of\nBramante, they appear to be the development and continuation of\nAlberti's.\n\n_But a question here occurs which is difficult to answer. Did\nLeonardo, till he quitted Florence, follow the direction given by\nthe dominant school of Brunellesco, which would then have given rise\nto his \"First manner\", or had he, even before he left Florence, felt\nAlberti's influence--either through his works (Palazzo Ruccellai,\nand the front of Santa Maria Novella) or through personal\nintercourse? Or was it not till he went to Milan that Alberti's work\nbegan to impress him through Bramante, who probably had known\nAlberti at Mantua about 1470 and who not only carried out Alberti's\nviews and ideas, but, by his designs for St. Peter's at Rome, proved\nhimself the greatest of modern architects. When Leonardo went to\nMilan Bramante had already been living there for many years. One of\nhis earliest works in Milan was the church of Santa Maria presso San\nSatiro, Via del Falcone[Footnote 1: Evidence of this I intend to\ngive later on in a Life of Bramante, which I have in preparation.].\n\nNow we find among Leonardos studies of Cupolas on Plates LXXXIV and\nLXXXV and in Pl. LXXX several sketches which seem to me to have been\nsuggested by Bramante's dome of this church.\n\nThe MSS. B and Ash. II contain the plans of S. Sepolcro, the\npavilion in the garden of the duke of Milan, and two churches,\nevidently inspired by the church of San Lorenzo at Milan.\n\nMS. B. contains besides two notes relating to Pavia, one of them a\ndesign for the sacristy of the Cathedral at Pavia, which cannot be\nsupposed to be dated later than 1492, and it has probably some\nrelation to Leonardo's call to Pavia June 21, 1490[Footnote 2: The\nsketch of the plan of Brunellesco's church of Santo Spirito at\nFlorence, which occurs in the same Manuscript, may have been done\nfrom memory.]. These and other considerations justify us in\nconcluding, that Leonardo made his studies of cupolas at Milan,\nprobably between the years 1487 and 1492 in anticipation of the\nerection of one of the grandest churches of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
