Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It can scarcely be doubted that some satirical intention is\nconveyed by the drawing on Pl. LXIV (text No. _688_).\n\nMy reason for not presenting Leonardo to the reader as a poet is the\nfact that the maxims and morals in verse which have been ascribed to\nhim, are not to be found in the manuscripts, and Prof. Uzielli has\nalready proved that they cannot be by him. Hence it would seem that\nonly a few short verses can be attributed to him with any\ncertainty._\n\nI.\n\nSTUDIES ON THE LIFE AND HABITS OF ANIMALS.\n\n1220.\n\nTHE LOVE OF VIRTUE.\n\nThe gold-finch is a bird of which it is related that, when it is\ncarried into the presence of a sick person, if the sick man is going\nto die, the bird turns away its head and never looks at him; but if\nthe sick man is to be saved the bird never loses sight of him but is\nthe cause of curing him of all his sickness.\n\nLike unto this is the love of virtue. It never looks at any vile or\nbase thing, but rather clings always to pure and virtuous things and\ntakes up its abode in a noble heart; as the birds do in green woods\non flowery branches. And this Love shows itself more in adversity\nthan in prosperity; as light does, which shines most where the place\nis darkest.\n\n1221.\n\nENVY.\n\nWe read of the kite that, when it sees its young ones growing too\nbig in the nest, out of envy it pecks their sides, and keeps them\nwithout food.\n\nCHEERFULNESS.\n\nCheerfulness is proper to the cock, which rejoices over every little\nthing, and crows with varied and lively movements.\n\nSADNESS.\n\nSadness resembles the raven, which, when it sees its young ones born\nwhite, departs in great grief, and abandons them with doleful\nlamentations, and does not feed them until it sees in them some few\nblack feathers.\n\n1222.\n\nPEACE.\n\nWe read of the beaver that when it is pursued, knowing that it is\nfor the virtue [contained] in its medicinal testicles and not being\nable to escape, it stops; and to be at peace with its pursuers, it\nbites off its testicles with its sharp teeth, and leaves them to its\nenemies.\n\nRAGE.\n\nIt is said of the bear that when it goes to the haunts of bees to\ntake their honey, the bees having begun to sting him he leaves the\nhoney and rushes to revenge himself. And as he seeks to be revenged\non all those that sting him, he is revenged on none; in such wise\nthat his rage is turned to madness, and he flings himself on the\nground, vainly exasperating, by his hands and feet, the foes against\nwhich he is defending himself.\n\n1223.\n\nGRATITUDE.\n\nThe virtue of gratitude is said to be more [developed] in the birds\ncalled hoopoes which, knowing the benefits of life and food, they\nhave received from their father and their mother, when they see them\ngrow old, make a nest for them and brood over them and feed them,\nand with their beaks pull out their old and shabby feathers; and\nthen, with a certain herb restore their sight so that they return to\na prosperous state.\n\nAVARICE.\n\nThe toad feeds on earth and always remains lean; because it never\neats enough:-- it is so afraid lest it should want for earth.\n\n1224.\n\nINGRATITUDE.\n\nPigeons are a symbol of ingratitude; for when they are old enough no\nlonger to need to be fed, they begin to fight with their father, and\nthis struggle does not end until the young one drives the father out\nand takes the hen and makes her his own.\n\nCRUELTY.\n\nThe basilisk is so utterly cruel that when it cannot kill animals by\nits baleful gaze, it turns upon herbs and plants, and fixing its\ngaze on them withers them up.\n\n1225.\n\nGENEROSITY.\n\nIt is said of the eagle that it is never so hungry but that it will\nleave a part of its prey for the birds that are round it, which,\nbeing unable to provide their own food, are necessarily dependent on\nthe eagle, since it is thus that they obtain food.\n\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nWhen the wolf goes cunningly round some stable of cattle, and by\naccident puts his foot in a trap, so that he makes a noise, he bites\nhis foot off to punish himself for his folly.\n\n1226.\n\nFLATTERERS OR SYRENS.\n\nThe syren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep;\nthen she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners.\n\nPRUDENCE.\n\nThe ant, by her natural foresight provides in the summer for the\nwinter, killing the seeds she harvests that they may not germinate,\nand on them, in due time she feeds.\n\nFOLLY.\n\nThe wild bull having a horror of a red colour, the hunters dress up\nthe trunk of a tree with red and the bull runs at this with\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
